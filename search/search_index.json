A static version can be downloaded here . Course Resources \u00b6 This website is the primary resource for all Critical Making Studio courses. Some of the resources used across the different courses are divided up into sections found on the left sidebar. Course specific resources will be found within the course schedule page specific to each course, also found on the left sidebar. Do I need to know all of these tools? No! Think of these resources as maps containing many possible tools that could help you accomplish your work and from which you can choose some to learn and work with. There are pros and cons to any tool and all have a set of functionalities and a purpose. As with any tool and any kind of personal creative process you are free to choose anything that works for you. In addition to the tools found here in the digital space, you have access to physical tools for building anything you can imagine here at the studio, on campus at the Idea Forge, or in the community at BLDG61. Our Studios \u00b6 CMCI Studio facilities include the large main room (West Studio) and adjacent smaller room (North Studio). Both rooms contain different functionalities for developing projects at varying scales and for varying audiences. Read through the Studio Handbook for learning about each room and accessing the various tools and capabilities we have on site. Idea Forge \u00b6 The Idea Forge is an on-campus design and fabrication facility open to all students located in the Fleming Building (near the Wolf Law Building at Broadway & Baseline Rd). In this course we will be making use of the tools and resources available to build projects and develop skills. Learn more at https://www.colorado.edu/ideaforge/ . CU Boulder Campus Map Hours Workshop Schedule BLDG61: Boulder Library Makerspace \u00b6 BLDG 61 is a free community workshop that provides maker education and technology to the public in a creative and inclusive environment. They are located nearby, just down the street from our studio. They offer a variety of free workshops and access to tools and knowledge within the larger Boulder community. I highly recommend becoming familiar with their space. Learn more at https://boulderlibrary.org/bldg61/ . Course Workload \u00b6 The CM1 is a 3 credit hour course. You should expect to dedicate at least 2-3 hours per credit hour. This translates into a 6-9 hours per week. Consider 6 hours a minimum expectation for one studio course and plan accordingly with your other studio courses. Assignments for the course consist of weekly blog posts demonstrating project-based and process oriented research and explorations in making . Assignment parameters will be based on the topic of the week and \"due\" the following week by the start of class time. Refer to the Course Deliverables section for more information. The course is organized into weekly meetings consisting of instructor led project-driven topics organized as workshops and studio work sessions. It is expected that all students are active participants in each session. Course Deliverables \u00b6 CM1 is a project based course and largely driven by student research and interests. As such, each deliverable is expected to vary based on the project parameters and requirements. The following outlines the general criteria for course deliverables throughout the semester. Blog Posts \u00b6 A minimum of 1 weekly blog post published to your Critical Making blog . Medium is widely used but any blogging platform may be used. Posts are to be submitted via slack #cmstudio by the specified due date each week. It is recommended that a post includes a variety of media and content to support the subject matter. For example: text, images, video, graphics, photos, mockups, screen captures, tutorials, 3d model viewers (sketchfab), sketches, code, gifs, references, etc. Anything that is required to effectively communicate the details of a project, process, prototype, or idea. The subject matter is in response to the topics of the week. Ideally, it falls in line with your interests, research area, project, creative process, etc. For example, you might consider doing a series of tutorials on a topic that interests you or a process/workflow you are currently exploring through the course. Posts should be written to the best of your abilities and for a public audience. The post and any accompanying visual content (images, video) may be shared on social media. In total, you should have minimum of 12 posts for the semester. Failure to submit all blog posts for this studio will result in a failing grade. 9 weekly blog posts for assignments.

If you are interested I can provide more details. Assignment 1: Know thyself \u00b6 Your first assignment consists of 3 parts: Part 1: Make a map Generate a map of some kind that communicates your journey to CMCI Studio. Such a map might be a timeline, visualization, info graphic, mind map, photographic series, video, written document, or any combination of these formats. Include your interests and pursuits in CMCI Studio. Questions: What led you to CMCI Studio? What is your question? Based on the survey, what do you feel strong in and what are you excited to learn more about through this course? Where do you see yourself by the end of the program? If you could design and build anything, what would it be? Part 2: Things I love and hate Choose 3 things you love (or like) and 3 things you hate (or dislike) and describe what they mean to you and why. Possible choices might be products, objects, artifacts, or experiences. Questions: What\u2019s their story? Who made them and why? Why do or did they exist? Why do you find them intriguing or despise them? Part 3: Setup a \"maker\" blog Setup a blog to document your Critical Making experience. What if I already have a website/blog? Great! Just make sure you tag or categorize your posts with \"Critical Making 1\" so they are easy to locate. If you do not yet have a blog or wish to setup a dedicated site for this course, you have a plethora of options to choose from . Feel free to use whatever works for you to submit your work in blog post format. Many STCM students choose to use Medium because it's used to submit posts for RE. Examples by previous students: Karen McClellan (C10), Allison Speigel (C10), Jonas Escobedo (C10), Sarah Cohen (C10), Diamond Alexander (C10), Kelly Phillips (C10), Hanshu Zhou (C10), Sarah Safranski (C9), Jim Murphy (C9), Matt Isola (C9), Nikki Cavalier (C9), Nick Balderston (C9) Examples of similar blogs: Chikara Inamura (HTMAA 2014) , Matt Keeter (HTMAA 2011) , Christos Tzamos(HTMAA 2014) , Zach Seibold (HTMAA 2014) , Merav Gazit (HTMAA 2014) , Dorota Orlof (FAB Academy 2018 Barcelona) Deliverable: Write and submit a blog post for Part 1 and Part 2 on the blog you setup in Part 3.

Assignment 2: Final Project Proposal \u00b6 Create a \"model\" (sketch, raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, video, simulate, etc.) of a possible final project. The word \"model\" is meant to be understood as any kind of digital or physical representation of an idea or concept you are excited about pursuing in your course of study in critical making. Perhaps you began to identify and outline some of this concept or related areas of inquiry in Assignment 1 . Also, don't worry too much about evolving your ideas as the semester progresses. It will likely happen. Think of this as a jumping off point. Possible examples: websites, applications, objects, artifacts, products, digital-physical experiences, installations, performances, platforms, artworks, tools, machines, devices, etc. Begin to think about the various concepts, tools, and technologies associated with your other studio courses and how they may inform the development of such a project. Also think about new tools or process encountered at Idea Forge or in the variety of Tools for Critical Making. Questions: What is your project concept? What is your motivation behind it? What problem are you interested in solving? How might you implement it? Deliverable: Write and submit a blog post with your project concept. Include any media and references or related work in your post that supports your thoughts and ideas. Share a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio before our next class. Due: Sept 16 Week 4: Terminal, Intro to Web Development \u00b6 Sept 16 For the next few weeks we will talk about web development paradigms and practices and you will begin to build your web development skills inside and outside of class. We will approach each topic with simplicity in mind and focus on understanding fundamental concepts. To build advanced skills with the tools we discuss you will need to dedicate time outside of class for further experimentation. We will approach topics in a hands-on workshop format so be prepared to dive in. If you do have some web development experience coming into the program think about some new aspects of development you are curious about such as libraries, frameworks, responsiveness, interactivity, animations, Javascript, types of tech stacks, or just how you can improve your skills in what you know through practice. The goal of the weeks ahead is to gain a sense of how you can utilize web technologies to solve problems. Info If you are curious about the history of electronics, computers, computer science, programming, and the Internet, check out the Histories section. I strongly advise you to start getting familiar with the various histories and technological underpinnings of the technologies you use every day. Remember, it's also about building awareness and understanding about the systems that run our world. These resources are meant to work through at your own speed and as you begin to ask deeper questions about why something works and how something works. The World Wide Web What is the World Wide Web, where did it come from, and what is its purpose? The purpose of building websites and web applications is to make an idea accessible to one or more people. How does it work? What is it made of? The Industry What do web developers do? What do web developers need to know? How do you learn web development skills? (HINT: Practice, practice, practice) Languages In the resources here you can find some learning pathways for building skills with these tools. Make time to read through the basics of all the languages and try things out. Most importantly, seek to apply the skills you are learning towards projects. HTML / Learning HTML & CSS CSS Javascript / Learning Javascript Development Environment Lets get started by setting up a development environment. The most basic things you need for any web development tasks are a text editor and a browser like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Other tools such as the Terminal, Git, Github, and Node.js enable you to work with all sorts of libraries and frameworks, collaborate with others, and quickly prototype new ideas. All these tools come together under the idea of running a \"local development server\" or localhost on your machine. Text Editors TextEdit - Default editor on MacOS ASCII vs Binary Files Atom - Free editor by Github Atom Packages / My Atom Setup Visual Studio Code (VSCode) - Free editor by Microsoft. My editor of choice. Terminal How I use terminal (preferences, themes, .bash_profile, aliases, etc) Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app Learning Terminal - Cheetsheets and more! Github - Website that hosts git repositories. Learning how to use version control systems such as Git and Github enable many people to collaborate. Learning Git - A great place to start learning about Git and Github. Local Development Server There are several ways to work with a local web server. Some are simpler than others to setup and configure. For our purposes we will often use a Node.js based live-server environment, which is really just a node module ( npm ) running on the Node.js Javascript framework. Its mostly a matter of personal or project preference which local web server option you use, if any. Sometimes development is done on a remote server (ie. AWS) or a combo of local and remote. How to Build a Sandbox - Short tutorial showing how to setup a flexible local development environment using Node.js. Examples of using live-server can be found at: cm-code/live-servers . Chrome Browser Chrome Dev Tools (Inspector for debugging). Access via: View > Developer > Developer Tools within Chrome. Terminal, Git, and Github Terminal Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app How do you display hidden files on MacOS? Look here Customize your Terminal in Terminal > Preferences. It helps to make the text larger on most screens. Common commands: cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm, mv, cp, pwd, man, touch . Think of all these commands as tiny applications that have no GUI. They are very old and have been around since the start of Unix based systems (Read this to learn more: Looking back at OS X's origins ). Look at MacOS/Linux/Unix Command Line Cheat Sheet to see more information about common commands. Working with directories and files: cd <folder> - Goto into a folder cd .. - Go up one level cd ../<folder> - Go up one level (to parent folder) and into a child folder cd ../.. - Go up two levels etc Tab completion - When you start typing in a terminal you can hit tab to complete the command if the file or folder you are going to use is available. If you hit Tab twice, you will see the contents of a folder. How to Setup Git You will likely not have Git installed on your machine. You will know if you have it or not when you type git into the Terminal. You may be prompted to install XCode Developer Tools in doing so. You have two options to install git: Install the XCode Developer tools (easy way) or download the installer from git-scm . After installing it the git command should work in the Terminal. How to Use Github Register for an account on Github. ( Stuck on choosing a username? Read this. A Tale of Github Usernames ) Create a repo on Github . If you check the box to add a README file it will include a README.md file in the repo. This is the main information file shown when you goto the repo URL. Markdown = text file with special syntax that gets converted into HTML. Review Markdown Cheatsheet . Clone Repo: git clone <repo url> . For Example, git clone git@github.com:rjduran/cm-sandbox.git . Note the URL and its use of \"git\" or \"https\". Use \"https\" to start. You need to go through the Github tutorial below to connect to Github via SSH. Make some changes: (Using text editor of some kind - Atom, VSCode, TextEdit) Stage the changes: git add index.html Commit the changes: git commit -m \"my message describing changes\" Push the changes: git push Pro tip: After setting up your Github account, read through Connecting to Github with SSH to setup your system to connect securely to Github and not require you to enter your username and password credentials each time you push changes. In Class Exercises Opening files in browser Setup a folder and create an index.html file in it. Insert some html and css code and reload in browser to view the changes. Repeat Using a local development server Setup local dev server (localhost). Insert some html and css code and watch the page change in browser automagically (because of live-server). Repeat Deconstructing Websites Look at a website you think is interesting. Using the Chrome development tools, inspect the site. Look at the page elements, the overall structure of the html, css, and js. Get familiar with the deveelopment tools interface / console. If you are more comfortable in Photoshop or Illustrator, take screenshots of the website and lay them out to annotate. Put screenshots on a layer and annotations on another layer. You could even use wireframe tools or hand sketch out the structure of pages and label elements by tag. Start matching up the page elements with HTML tags - h1, h2, p, li, a, div, etc. (Tip: Look at W3 Schools HTML Element Reference ) Assignment 3: Intro to Web Development \u00b6 The goal of this week is to get familiar with a variety of web development tools and skills. You will work with HTML/CSS to build a simple webpage, you will choose a website to deconstruct, and you will get familar with the Terminal. You should also have a basic understanding of how to use Git and Github to commit and push files to a repository and pull or clone files from a repository on Github. These aspects of development will be used throughout the rest of the class so you there will be many chances to practice. This assignment has 3 parts: Part 1: Setup your local development environment We will work through some of these items in class. If you get stuck, look at the notes above, ask a neighbor, or send a message via slack. With this setup you should be able to protoype any kind of website or web app locally via live-server running in the Terminal and browser. (Hint: Work through this tutorial to complete Part 1. How to Build a Sandbox ) Install a Text Editor Install Git Install Node.js Install live-server (npm) Open Browser and goto http://127.0.0.1:8080/ Part 2: Deconstruct a website Choose a 1-2 pages of a website to deconstruct and analyze it to the best of your abilities. For this exercise, just focus on the HTML elements of the pages. Optional: If you want to go a step further, attempt to deconstruct the styles and javscript used in the page too. The purpose of this is to gain an understanding of what a developer does to translate web designs or wireframes into functional code. Utilize tools such as the Chrome development tools and an annotation method to describe the overall structure of a page. Annotate HTML elements with text labels over screenshots of the website, wireframes, or hand sketches. Embed your annotated images into your blog post with a brief writeup of your process and outcomes. Part 3: Ode to Things Choose one (or more) every day object(s) in your life and make a simple website for it / them. You might consider the site as a container for a favored item or collection of things, a product to sell, or simply a site that pays tribute to the item or object and what it means to you in life. This idea was inspired by the website Ode to Things , which is an e-commerce store and curated collection of physical every day products. Example code from class: lime-cat Build a webpage from scratch that makes use of html elements and css selectors. Use necessary html elements that act as containers for different types of content and page heirarchy: text, images, video, etc. Develop your webpage using your local development environment setup in Part 1. When done, make a repository on Github for your project and commit the index.html and any media files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result. Deliverable: A 1-2 min video screen capture demonstrating your local development environment as setup in Part 1 and your webpage built in Part 3. Embed the video into your blog post. Tip If you are new to screen capture tools, look into using Screencast-o-matic to document your workflow. Create an account with Youtube or Vimeo if necessary and upload your video. Note: MacOS (Mojave) has a built in screen recorder tool with key command Shift + Command + 5. Include a link to your Github repo for the code written in Part 3 in your blog post. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about web development and the tools used? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio before our next class.

Week 5: Computational Thinking, Intro to Javascript \u00b6 Sept 23 Assignment 3 Review Terminal Questions Git/Github Questions What are the steps to working with a git repo local or remote? ( Hint: Look at the Github notes from last week. ) Web Development Review Web Development Learning Pathways Learning HTML & CSS Learning Javascript W3 How-To Examples - A great set of how-to examples for various web topics. What are the primary development file types and what do they do? HTML = Document Structure CSS = Visual Identity JS = Interactivity At a basic level all you need is a single index.html file to render a webpage. All the CSS and JS you may have can exist inside the same file embedded within <style>...</style> and <script>...</script> elements. It only becomes important to separate the 3 types of code when a project becomes too large to manage within a single file. Best practices, modularity, and the need for regular maintenance have led developers towards a current approach of establishing and using style guides or coding standards . What are CSS selectors and how do they relate to HTML elements? What is the difference between embedded and linked CSS and how do you use both types?

Computational Thinking Computational thinking is the thought process involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution(s) in such a way that a computer\u2014human or machine\u2014can effectively carry out. ( Wikipedia ) Q: How does one think like a programmer or computer scientist? How to think like a programmer\u200a\u2014\u200alessons in problem solving Understand the problem and describe it simply Plan out how to tackle it (ie. pseudocode) Divide the problem into smaller pieces Stuck?

How can I learn to think like a computer programmer? - Read through the first response. What is Pseudocode? - TLDW; It's logic written out in plain english that you then translate into the programming language of choice. Blockly - A visual programming framework based on the famous Scratch project by the Lifelong Kindergarden group at the MIT Media Lab. Q: How can I get better at programming / thinking / making / problem solving this way? The short and honest answer is that it takes lots of practice. Look to solve as many problems as you can using programming (and in the process practice computational thinking). It takes an interest and willingness to jump into new tools and code on the regular. Try out as many different languages, libraries and frameworks as you can that address the problems of interest. Read books. Read / work through tutorials and examples. Watch videos. Solve problems. Think about what kind of learner you are and how you navigate resources when learning new skills. Start with the resources in Learning Javascript . Related to the above discussion about programming and such, here are a few things to read if you are concerned with needing to have a strong background in math to accomplish anything with Javascript or another programming language. I hope this also addresses the question of \"What amount and kind of math would you need to use to improve as a programmer?\" And I use the word \"improve\" because its a practice like other forms of making and creativity. Which takes time to practice and master.

The best way to start experimenting with JS is to play with it in an sandbox or local development environment, like what you setup last week using the live-server npm module. Chrome Developer Tools > Console and console.log() are your best friend when debugging JS code. Think of this statement as a way to put your code and the way it functions under the microscope when the browser runs it. How To Use the JavaScript Developer Console - A great intro tutorial explaining how and why to use the console. DOM (Document Object Model) The DOM is a standard object model and programming interface created by the browser when a webpage is loaded. It is essentially your HTML page but in a different format now accessible through a browser based programming interface and language (Javascript). In general, JS can manipulate (get, change, add, delete) any part of the DOM (ie. any part of a page or document). Here's a great image of the DOM DOM Tree Visualization Example on CodePen Try opening the Chrome Developer Console and typing document or window . What does it return? How does it relate to the DOM image above? JavaScript DOM Tutorial Series (Video Playlist) - A great series of videos introducing the DOM and how to manipulate it with Javascript. It totals 2 hrs in duration but is extremely helpful to understand some aspects of the Javascript language and how it can be used. Eloquent Javascript: CH 14 - The Document Object Model Some things you can use JS for: Change / Remove HTML elements in the DOM / on the page Change and add CSS styles to elements Read and change element attributes (href, src, alt, and more) Create new HTML elements and insert them into the DOM / page Attach event listeners to elements (click, keypress, submit) Send/Request data to/from an API Language Fundamentals Javascript is a programming language that while it has an abundance of learning resources freely available on the web it still takes years to master for most people. Try not to feel discouraged since you are likely new to programming and understanding the various aspects of web development. As with most programming languages and tools for building the web, always start by seeking out documentation and resources on the subject. I have several books listed in the Learning JS section. Most of them are good entry points. Additionally, every programming language that is widely used will have some kind of language reference with examples of how to use it. Many can be copied and pasted into the console or script to run. Below are some resources pointing at aspects of the Javascript language. Language Overviews Javascript for Cats is an entertaining overview that covers the most important parts of the language. Javascript Basics (p5.js wiki) is a quick-ish overview of the language and how to use it with or without p5.js . Language References Mozilla Javascript Reference Variables Numbers Operators Booleans Strings Conditionals Loops Functions Arrays Strings Objects JSON Events & Event Listeners How to work with events - Element changes, Key presses, Mouse movements Events and the DOM JS Timing Events - Learn more here about how to make events that trigger in time. Assignment 4: JS in Action \u00b6 The goal of this week is to gain a better understanding of Javascript by researching uses that interest you and by experimentation with the developer console. Part 1 is required but Part 2 is optional. I highly encourage you to work through part 2 because it will further your understanding of how to work with the language in the browser. This assignment has 2 parts: Part 1: JS Examples Research 2-3 examples of Javascript in action. Look at the resources above and investigate uses of JS that interest you. Try to identify what the JS is doing behaviorally when you interact with it or by observing its dynamic behavior in a page. Attempt to identify libraries (if any) that are used to build the functionality you see and interact with. Javascript is so versatile that at times it might be difficult to decipher from simply looking at the behavior in the browser. You have to dig into the Developer Tools and inspect beyond the page elements and into the files that are being downloaded from the server (Hint: Look in the Network tab within the Developer Tools). let me google that for you... List of JS Examples (Added on 4 Oct 2019) High Rise Ultra Noir - Nouvelle Vague Histography St Louis Browns Raoul Gaillard IBM Design Andeinerseite React Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe Clayton Tic-Tac-Toe App Clayton Name Rotate Homepage NYT All Birds Codepen Wellcure BBC: Real Happiness Project Drawmote Frere Jones Starbucks Creative Expression Travel Visa Inequality World Migration Map - Info Cup Noodle Leg Work Studio Multeor Masi Tupungato Pocketnet Brooks Running WWOOF Weave Silk The Boat Debbie Millman Part 2: Experiment with the DOM (Optional) Work through the resources and exercises below to gain familiarity with the developer console and the Document Object Model (DOM). To get started: Clone cm-javascripting and start up a live-server in the \"starter\" directory. With live-server running, open the Chrome Developer tools Console and enter: document . You will get a representation of the entire HTML document as an object. The document object is the top level object in the DOM. Read through this list of Properties and Methods for the document object and to understand what you can see in the console. Use this as a reference for the following challenges. Watch the videos 1-5 in this tutorial series to get a sense of how to complete the following challenges. Console Basics: Tip: As you type code into the developer console be careful not to reload the page or you will wipe out what is in the console. To keep a backup of the Javascript entered just make a temporary .txt or .js file and copy and paste your code. You can follow along in this video for console basics. Open the Developer Console and type document . Define an integer variable: var a = 1; Define a string variable: var name = \"Your Name\"; Define an array that stores numbers: 1,3,5,7,9 Define a function called \"helloWorld\" that prints \"Hello World\" to the console when called. Defing a function called \"printName\" that prints out your name when called; Define a function that prints any name entered as parameter when called. What happens when you overwrite an existing function? DOM Basics: Getting Elements Get a reference to all the paragraph (p) tags in the document. Hint: Look at getElementsByTagName() Get a reference to a paragraph tag with a specific id of \"second\". Hint: Look at getElementById() Get a reference to a all paragraph tags with a class of \"first\". Hint: Look at getElementsByClassName() Get a reference to an element or elements within another element. For example, if you have an unordered list (ul) with several list items (li), how do you select a specific li and display it's contents to the console? Change the active color of the sidebar to red. Changing Elements Change the text within a sidebar list item (li) to \"Foo\". Change the text within the previously selected list item (li) to \"Greetings List Item! I'm a string from another planet!\". Change the text of a specific paragraph to a different string of text. Use an Ipsum generator tool to create new placeholder text that you insert using Javascript. Removing Elements Clear the contents of the paragraph with an id of \"empty-me\". Clear the contents of the set of paragraphs with class \"empty-us\". Remove the div with a specific id of \"section3\". Adding Elements Create a new anchor tag that links to your blog and insert it just after the paragraph tag in the div with an id of \"about\". Append a new div anywhere in the document and give it an id of your choice. Insert a paragraph with some content into the div using javascript. Add a new list item to the sidebar ul that links to your new div so you can click and scroll to it. Add a new list item with URL to www.google.com in the sidebar. Event Listeners Make an event listener for any h2 element that triggers an alert() when you click it. Set the alert message to \"Hey Hey Hey!\". Make an event listener that triggers a change in the text of a specific paragraph with the id \"change-me\". Deliverable: A 1-2 min video screen capture showing the examples you researched in Part 1. Talk about how the examples work from the perspective of user exeprience and design. What need is being met by using JS in this context? Embed the video into your blog post. (Optional) If you worked through Part 2, demonstrate some of your workflow in the developer console and describe what's going on. Include this portion in your video. (Optional) Create a github repo for this assignment called \"cm1-a4-javascripting\" to document the code you created for Part 2. Include a link to your repo for the code written in your blog post. Look at some Markdown resources for writing a good README for your Github project if you haven't used the Markdown language yet. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about web development and the tools used? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio before our next class.

JSON JSON Syntax Assignment 5: Digital Legos \u00b6 The goal of this week is to make something using one or more CSS and/or JS libraries or frameworks. Choose from the list above or locate something else and explore it. My suggestion for exploring something visual / dynamic / interactive is to start with P5.js . If you want to dig deeper into making something more practical as a website experience with common UI elements then look into jQuery and jQueryUI and Bootstrap to start. If you are feeling like you want to delve into the world of Node.js, Three.js, or AFrame, check out the resources on the left sidebar. Thoughts on getting started: If you have a web based project in mind for your final project or another project, begin to identify what tools you might use to build that project and attempt to work on a piece of it. What functionalites does the project need? (Maybe there's a library for it) How do you see the project working from the user experience? What design elements can you identify and how might they be coded? Make a list of questions you have about the interactive and/or dynamic behaviour observed on websites you have visited and are inspired by. What's intriguing to you about the websites and how they work? Investigate libraries that seem interesting to you. Assess their capabilities and how you can apply it to a project. Try to be as specific as possible when invesitgating a library or framework. What is your motivation for learning it and what do you want to accomplish with it? Identify some specific uses of it and focus. Start simple. Dont try to understand it all. If you copy and paste code from somewhere, copy one line at a time and learn what it does. Then add more code and repeat. It's easier to start simply and build up complex functionlaity than to work the other way. Look for \"getting started\" documentation about a library or framework. Work through it and see where it takes you. Google is your best friend. Use comments (in JS, HTML, or CSS) to write notes to yourself. Work together! Share code, ideas, and libraries you find with eachother. Have fun with it! Deliverable: A 1-2 min video screen capture showing what you made. Talk about the libraries you experimented with, what you learned, and what your goals were. Embed the video into your blog post. Create a github repo for this assignment to document the code you created. Include a link to your repo for the code written in your blog post. Look at some Markdown resources for writing a good README for your Github project if you haven't used the Markdown language yet. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about web development and the tools used? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio before our next class. Due: Oct 7 Week 7: Intro to Physical Computing, Intro to Arduino \u00b6 Oct 7 Assignment 5 Share JavaScript is not Java, but you will be using a language similar to Java called C++ . This term is synonymous with \"Arduino\" since its the programming language used. We're moving on to look at electronics, hardware, and looking at how we design interactive systems with it. What is Physical Computing? Physical Computing is an approach to computer-human interaction design that starts by considering how humans express themselves physically. Computer interface design instruction often takes the computer hardware for given \u2014 namely, that there is a keyboard, a screen, speakers, and a mouse or trackpad or touchscreen \u2014 and concentrates on teaching the software necessary to design within those boundaries. In physical computing, we take the human body and its capabilities as the starting point, and attempt to design interfaces, both software and hardware, that can sense and respond to what humans can physically do. This means that we have to learn how a computer converts the changes in energy given off by our bodies, in the form of heat, light, sound, and so forth, into changing electronic signals that it can be read and interpreted by computers. In physical computing, this is accomplished by connecting sensors to the simplest of computers, called microcontrollers, in order to read these changes and interpret them as actions. Within the microcontroller, custom software acts as the behaviour or control logic driving a variety of digital and physical outputs such as graphics, light, motion, and sound. Source 1: Adapted from \"What is Physical Computing?\" by Tom Igoe (ITP, NYU) Source 2: Intro to Physical Computing Slides by Danny Rozin (ITP, NYU) First, some fun examples... There's no lack of interesting projects out there at this time (2019). The field of physical computing has been evolving since the introduction of the Arduino in 2005. Circula WePlug Dripping Machine for Ceramics Minimalist Greeting Robot Rot Bot Pacman Costumes Face Trade Arduino (what? why?) Arduino is an open-source hardware and software platform for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical and digital world. Inputs (Sensors) -> Behavior (Software) -> Outputs (Action) You can think about this type of device (microcontroller) as the interface between the physical and digital world. It allows you to translate physical phenomena into digital information and act upon it with software (code) to produce a kind of digital or physical output such as flashing a light or turning a motor. The Arduino and connected devices can be thought of as hardware \"LEGOS\" or building blocks to construct complex electro-mechanical, interactive, and responsive systems.

Example: Arduino Uno Schematic , Breadboard vs Schematic Arduino Boards Official Arduino Boards Arduino Uno Specs Arduino Uno Pinout Guide There are many different shapes and sizes of Arduino's available, how do you choose hardware for a project? Look for a guide such as the Arduino Comparison Guide by Sparkfun to start. Decide what your project will do and what inputs and outputs it has. Also take into consideration how you plan to use the Arduino. Does it use data from the physical world? Does it need to display information? Do you need all the features available in the board or can you get away with a smaller/cheaper/less capable one? How much do you have to spend on the project? Look at the cost of supplies. Luckily most Arduinos are cheap but components and devices can add up. Software Arduino IDE - Download and Install.

Explore creative uses of the input and out device(s) you choose to work with. From class we know that buttons cause some kind of action to happen. What\u2019s the action you wish to design for? We also know that LEDs are a common response from systems that need to communicate its status, its state, or its mode of operation -- they are used to signal us in some way. They are used in many situations to tell us something through color, brightness, pulsing, state changes, and light. What will your system communicate through the use of an LED as an output device? Some examples / use cases to build from: Timers - push a button, start timer on screen or visible through changing LED colors Alarms - push button, set alarm, turn on LED when time is up Light Sequence - push a button or initiate a sequence of events, begin light sequence(s) You are welcome to explore other input and output devices such as environmental sensors (temperature, etc), servo motors, and relays to create a project with more functionality if you wish. You may also explore the use of the Processing environment as an output device or input device. Examples of this could be to change the color of a Processing sketch in response to a physical button press or knob turning plugged into an Arduino or an LED changing color in response to a set of swatch colors being chosen in a Processing sketch. To look at how serial communication works in this way you will want to investigate the examples shown under the Arduino + Processing section in the cm-arduino repo. Some common interactions with input/output devices: Press Button (Physical) -> Arduino -> Flash RGB LED Red (Physical) Occlude Photoresistor (Physical) -> Arduino -> Print value to Serial Port (Digital) Turn Potentiometer (Knob) (Physical) -> Arduino -> Display value on LCD Display (Physical) Press Button (Physical) -> Arduino -> Send Data on USB (Serial Port) -> Receive Data in Processing Sketch (Digital) Thoughts on getting started: Start by building understanding of the 4 built-in examples - Blink , Button , AnalogReadSerial , and AnalogInOutSerial . These 4 examples are the building blocks of many kinds of projects. Each example has pictures of how to build the circuit. Replicate the circuit exactly as you see it and read the notes for each to understand more about it. Next move on to understanding how the examples in cm-arduino work starting with RGB_LED_01. Here's a video of the examples hooked up and working . Dont try to go too far too fast. Take your time to connect wires to the correct locations on a bread board. You will likely need to hook circuits up a few times to get something working. Make sure you upload the correct Arduino sketch. The board you use may contain a previous sketch in memory when you first start to use it. Its good practice to \"reflash\" the Arduino with an empty sketch just to be sure it's not running another program that could cause issues with hardware you are wiring up. If you encounter what seems like a hardware issue or strange behavior, you might have something hooked up incorrectly or maybe even missing a connection. Double check the circuit diagram and retrace your steps. Work together! Have fun with it! Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing what you made. Include recorded video of your hardware working as designed and screen shots or photos of specific moments of interest you encounter and wish to communicate in the project development. Talk about the types of input and output devices used, interactions you designed for, what you learned, and what your goals were. Embed the video into your blog post. Draw a circuit diagram of your project using Fritzing and insert it into your blog post. Note: This tool is used to make the circuit diagrams shown on every Arduino example page. Create a github repo for this assignment to document the code you created. If you built something that makes use of both Arduino and Processing be sure to include folders for both types of sketches. Include a link to your repo for the code written in your blog post. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about physical computing and the tools used?

Intro to Raspberry Pi A Raspberry Pi is a fully functional single-board computer capable of running various Linux distributions (aka Operating Systems). It's used for all kinds of IoT / connected physical computing applications where internet connectivity, bluetooth, HDMI, audio, or more advanced hardware is required. What does that mean? Well, its a small computer that fits in your pocket that can be programmed in almost any language, powered by almost any power source, and used in a variety of applications. If you care to learn more about its history and where it gots it's name, read this Quora thread . \"The \"Raspberry\" derives is an homage to early computer companies being named after fruit, like Apple, Tangerine Computer Systems, Apricot Computers, and Acorn (which inspired the microcomputer\u2019s design). The \"Pi\" derives from the original idea to make a small computer to run only the Python programming language.\" Here are a few examples of what you might do with a Raspberry Pi: Web Server Kiosk Budget computer running many different flavors of Linux Media Server (Similar to Apple TV, Roku) - OSMC File Server IoT / Home Automation / Physical Computing WiFi Router / Access Point Custom VPN Retro Gaming System - retropi Photo Booth Time Lapse Camera System Internet Radio Device - Mopidy DIY Alexa Device (Look at links below) Programming / Education (This is where it all started of course!)

So...How is this different from an Arduino? There are so many differences and many similarities but ultimately it comes down to understanding what each type of board is (how we classify it), what it is good and bad at (pros and cons), and what it offers given the parameters of a project. I also like this human based analogy from a user in the Quora thread - \"What are the differences between Arduino and Raspberry Pi?\" . Arduino is like the spinal cord. It connects to a large number of peripherals and provides spontaneous communication. Good for low-intelligence tasks. Raspberry Pi is like the brain. Its primary advantage comes in processing higher level processing capability. Arduino => Microcontroller Raspberry Pi => Microcomputer (single-board microcomputer) Ways of comparring devices to answer questions: There are so many types (Ver 3, Ver 4, Zero W, A+, etc. ), which to choose?

Assignment 7: Strange Computers \u00b6 Reviewing the landscape of increasingly accessible electronics, the hardware building blocks (input and output devices) of complex interactions, and strange little computers known as microcontrollers, we find ourselves now engaging with the single-board micro-computer known as the Raspberry Pi . The task this week is to dive into the world of single-board micro-computers by making something with the Raspberry Pi. \"With\" being the keyword here. You could take it to mean \"build a system with the device as the platform running code to perform some action\" similar to working with an Arduino or you might consider just using the Raspberry Pi environment to try out a new piece of software running on it and have the goal of making something using the built-in tools available. Tools such as Mathematica or Sonic-Pi come preinstalled on the full desktop version of Raspbian. You might even consider exploring an alternative operating system or \"disk image\" that does something more specialized out of the box like retropi or openframe . Ways to engage: You are welcome to approach this weeks assignment solo or with a partner. I recommend working together regardless. It's a great way to troubleshoot / motivate / question / learn. If you dont know where to start, begin by making a list of questions about possible uses of the technology that matter to you. In what ways will you engage with it? What's clear about it? Whats confusing about it? What do you know about it? Whats mysterious? What's its purpose? Why use it? Then attempt to answer those questions. Make a map. Similar to what I shared in class, make a map to tease out some understanding about the technology and it's place in the world. Where do you engage with it? For what purpose? To what end or final cause ? If you found some success using Arduino's and input/output devices, and feel confident enough trying out another platform in this way, consider working through some tutorials about how to make the Raspberry Pi perform similar tasks. Then look at what else it can do that's different from an Arduino. Start simple just as you would on an Arduino. For example, here's a tutorial on a Blink example similar to Blink on Arduino. Focus on a feature. For example, make something that uses bluetooth functionality for connectivity and sharing data. Bluetooth speakers, headphones, and smart devices all use bluetooth to share data. If you are interested in the deployment of this device as a webserver providing static content and/or connected to hardware, check out the W3 tutorial on Node.js and Raspberry Pi . Look at projects and tutorials!! Use the resources above and the Google machine to find some projects or tutorials that interest you. Follow them and identify what works and what doesn't. What's intriguing about it? How easy or difficult is the project to build? How easy are the instructions to follow? What if you were to write up or document your project in a similar way? How would you do it? Working with this tool may require learning something about new programming languages to realize an idea or run a bit of code someone previously made open-source. Try it out and see what happens. Locate a good resource (book, website, series of tutorials) to learn enough of the programming language to understand how to run the code. Something working thw wrong way is better than nothing always. Ways of connecting to and use a Raspberry Pi device: By connecting up a display, mouse, and keybaord to the Pi USB ports. This is by far the easiest but requires the peripherials. In the terminal via SSH and ip address. For example, ssh pi@192.168.0.25 . This is the command line interface (CLI) approach. Be sure to use with your correct IP address for the device. Using a desktop VNC tool to see the desktop environment of Raspbian running on the Pi. For example, VNC Viewer . To transfer files back and forth on any connected device you can use an FTP/SFTP tool like Cyberduck or the built in command line tools such as scp in terminal. Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing what you made. Include recorded video, screen capture, images, audio, or graphics of your explorations working. Include screen shots or photos of specific moments of interest you encounter and wish to communicate in the project development. Consider adding more details to your videos by talking over the clips, adding music or sound, and using labels or callouts to increase production quality. Talk about the types of tools and software used, input and output devices used, interactions or behaviours you designed for, what you learned, and what your goals of the project were. Embed the video into your blog post. (Optional) If needed, draw a circuit diagram of your project using Fritzing and insert it into your blog post. (Optional) Create a github repo for any code used in this assignment. Include a link to your repo for the code written in your blog post. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about the Raspberry pi? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio before our next class. Due: Oct 21 Week 9: Digital Design & Fabrication / Intro to Fusion 360 \u00b6 Oct 21 Assignment 7 Share Idea Forge From CAD to CAM! This is our trajectory for the next 3 weeks. Digital Design (aka CAD) A short history of sketching and blueprints. What happened before computers? Vintage Photos: Life Before AutoCAD What is CAD and why do we use it to make things? What kinds of things are possible with CAD? ( Hint: Look around. What do you see? Almost everything in our human built environment is made using an industrialized CAD/CAM process. ) CAD Tools 2D - Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, etc 3D - Fusion 360, Autocad, Inventor, Solidworks, Rhino, etc Digital Fabrication (aka CAM) Digital fabrication is a type of manufacturing process where the machine used is controlled by a computer. The most common forms of digital fabrication are CNC Machining, Laser Cutting, and 3D Printing. ( Source: Open Desk ), Google Search , Digital Fabrication Pintrest Board by Naz\u0131m Da\u011fdeviren CAD -> CAM CAD = Computer-Aided Design Input: Idea for 3D model; Output: 3D model and instructions for CAM. CAM = Computer-Aided Manufacturing Input: Toolpath file / instructions; Output: Physical Object Typical Digital Design to Physical Production Workflow Step 1: Design with one or more CAD tools for the desired production method(s). Step 2: Fabricate by hand (ie. cut, carve, bend, sand, etc), with manually controlled machines (ie. Mill, Lathe, Saw, Drill, etc), with Computer Numerically Controlled Machines (ie. CNC Mill, CNC Router, 3D Printer, Laser Cutter, Plasma Cutter, Water Jet Cutter, etc) or some combination of all methods. In general, most workflows consist of a series of steps where specific tools and knowledge are put into action to complete the step and move to the next step in the process. In terms of digital to physical workflows, we're always dealing with data in some form / file format. Its good practice to get familiar with input and output formats for any CAD tool you work with because you then know what the tool is capable of and how other tools can interface with it. Most CAD environments can work with a variety of 3D file formats such as .STL, .OBJ, .STEP, and many others. 3D Meshes A polygon mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object in 3D computer graphics and solid modeling. The faces usually consist of triangles (triangle mesh), quadrilaterals (quads), or other simple convex polygons (n-gons), since this simplifies rendering, but may also be more generally composed of concave polygons, or even polygons with holes.

CAD How do you prepare a design and print it? Use a Slicer tool to produce GCODE needed by printer. See below. What kinds of materials are used? PLA or ABS are the most common. What kind of printing process should I use? It depends on the thing you want to make, how much you want to spend on it, and the material you want/need to use. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most common and cheapest. Additive Manufacturing Technologies (Image) , Source: 3D Hubs Slicing for 3D Printing Slicing tools convert a 3D mesh (STL) into GCODE to run the printer. This is not to be confused with the Autodesk tool - \"[Slicer for Fusion 360]( Slicer for Fusion 360 \". That is a tool for converting 3D models into 2D pieces that can be cut on a laser cutter with 2D sheet material to assemble into a 3D model after. Cura is what we use for the Ultimaker 3. Slicing Process Load STL file into Cura Choose PLA material for Extruder 1 and PVA for Extruder 2 (If using support material) Choose a print profile (aka Layer Height: Start with Fast or Normal options) Choose an infill (Density) Save GCODE file and copy to USB drive Designing for Laser Cutting How do you design a 3d model to laser cut? CAD. Use a CAD tool to design in 3D and convert a 3D shape into 2D pieces. Sometimes this step requies specialized software. See below. How do you prepare a design and laser cut it? Use a vector graphics tool like AI to layout file and assign color mapping. This is how the system will know what machine settings to use for the paths in your file. What kinds of materials are used? Sheet material - Paper, wood, cardboard, plastics. What methods can you use to make a 3D object out of flat 2D sheet material? Look at examples in Slicer for Fusion 360. More advanced versions of these techniques are referenced in the resources below and mostly use Rhino + Grasshopper to implement.

Alternative method: Use the DXF exporting script here for exporting many named sketches. Layout the DXF file in Adobe Illustrator or another vector graphics or CAD program in preparation for laser cutting. Assign colors to paths for vector cutting (red stroke), vector scoring (blue stroke), and raster engraving (black fill). The color mapping will depend on the system used.

I highly recommend you use the 3D printers and laser cutter at the Idea Forge to complete this assignment. Note this assignment will take time to design, fabricate, and assemble so get started asap. Also, note the Idea Forge does NOT have weekend hours for printing and using the laser. For 3D Printing: You may utilize the printer in our studio if you have walked through it with me or another student. There is currently a limited amount of material and only 1 machine in our studio so I advise you to purchase a roll of PLA filament if you would like to print something larger than 2-3 in or in a specific color. Gizmodorks or Amazon are great places to find a roll of 3.0 mm PLA filament. They are around $20-$30 for a 2.2kg roll. You could even share the cost with others. Pay attention to the size of your model and print times. For Laser Cutting: You can use the system at the Idea Forge once you have files prepared. In general, you will need to have a vector graphics file in .AI, .DXF, or .EPS to interface with their system. I assume most people use Adobe Illustrator and can create a file for this purpose. The Idea Forge has an Epilog Fusion 40 machine with a bed size of 40 x 28 in. Setup an Artboard in Illustrator to this size as we did in class. For materials, start with 3 mm or approx 1/8\" thick cardboard and design to these specifications. Always check with the Idea Forge staff on correct protocols for printing and laser cutting. Thoughts on getting started: Sketch out on paper something original that addresses a need. Do you need a case for your Arduino or Raspberry Pi based project? Determine the specifications for your case and draw it in CAD. Hint: Look for tutorials on this. There are alot. Explore one or more digital fabrication methods (contouring, triangulation, waffle, unrolling geometry, or some combination of these) and produce a physical instance of it. For example, you might have a 3d model that you would like to produce at large scale. Larger than might be possible in a single 3d print within a reasonable amount of time. What method would you use to produce your model? What if the model were triangulated? Or contoured? What material would you choose? What steps need to be taken in the digital domain to translate into components that can be produced and assembled physically? Analyze and recreate an existing product or object you find interesting Maybe you have a final project idea that requires physical parts? Can they be printed or laser cut? Do you have any product ideas? What method of manufacture might work to make them tangible? Explore some of the resources listed for 3D printing. Look through the design guides below and seek out additional resources to aid your design process. As with most ideas turned into CAD models, I suggest start by hand sketching your ideas out. Think about the problem you wish to solve or the questions you have around whats possible with this tool / medium / material. Think about the forms you want to model, the parts you want to use in an assembly, the mechanical movements you wish to explore, etc. Don't let the tools or process get in the way of you producing an instance of your idea. Start simple and make many iterations until you get to something that communicates your intent. Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing what you made. Include recorded video, screen capture, images, audio, or graphics of your explorations working. Include screen shots or photos of specific moments of interest you encounter and wish to communicate in the project development. Consider adding more details to your videos by talking over the clips, adding music or sound, and using labels or callouts to increase production quality. Talk about the types of tools and software used. Talk about your workflow from design to physical object. Embed the video into your blog post. Physical model(s). Bring all models produced to class. Take photos of completed models and put them in your documentation. Export a mesh (STL File) of your model and upload it to Sketchfab (You will need to make an account). Once uploaded to Sketchfab, embed your uploaded model into your blog post. Here's a tutorial about how to do this . This is basically the same as embedding a Youtube video into a blog post, but with a 3D viewer window containing your model, which you can manipulate and even visualize in VR! Cool eh!? A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about 3d modeling or digital fabrication? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio before our next class. Due: Oct 28 Week 10: No Class \u00b6 Oct 28 Class canceled due to weather conditions - https://alerts.colorado.edu/ Week 11: Parametric Design \u00b6 Nov 4 Assignment 8 Share This week we will be looking at Rhino & Grasshopper for parametric design. While it is possible to utilize Fusion 360 in similar ways through User Parameters and python scripting (via Fusion 360 API), it really is a different design paradigm and I encourage you to explore it. This toolset will be our primary environment for Spring 2020 course APRD-5017: Parametric Product Design. As time allows, we will look at making quick renders using Keyshot. Rhino & Grasshopper Overview What is Rhino? Rhino is a CAD tool for designers and architects. It's considered one of the standard 3d modeling tools for product designers across many different industries. Rhino Download for macOS - Free for 90 days. Edu License available for ~$90 @ CU Bookstore. Rhinoceros will be in your Applications folder after install. What is Grasshopper ? Grasshopper is an node-based algorithmic modeling environment plugin for Rhino. As of Rhino 6.0 it's included when you install. You access it by typing Grasshopper into the command interface in Rhino. When you launch the tool it will open a separate window that overlays the Rhino window. Just position Rhino on half of your screen and Grasshopper on the other half. Old Grasshopper Website / Forum Current Grasshopper Forum Google Search: Rhino Grasshopper Rhino for Windows vs Rhino for macOS Rhino for Windows is much older than Rhino for macOS and therefore contains a bit more functionality (for now). There are many open-source and proprietary plugins available for both Rhino and Grasshopper but not all are compatible for both operating systems yet. To get something to work the way you want, you sometimes need to use both OSes. Grasshopper on Mac Component Compatibility Testing : Components Rhino 6 for Windows commands not in Rhino 6 for Mac Whats possible with Rhino + Grasshopper? Why use them? There are many design oriented or industry specific reasons but one BIG reason to use the tool is for its extendability through plugins (food4Rhino) for both Rhino and Grasshopper. Plugins such as Grasshopper enable all sorts of design possibilities in computational design, parametric design , and generative design . Parametric Design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.

PictureFrame Contour MeshtoNURB Distance Dim Boolean commands Hide / Show Offset DupBorder ExtractWireframe Text TextObject SelDup ExtrudeSrf Make2D Generator or \"Factory\" Examples Produce variations of a 3d model from a \"generator\" or \"factory\". This means to work iteratively to explore a form making process where the designer changes features of the system to produce a family of different results. This process takes advantage of the History command to associate recorded parameters to each other, which is a characteristic of Parametric Modeling as done naturally in Fusion 360 and further enabled through Grasshopper. The following examples are in the cm-design/rhino folder. Example 1: Parametric Loft Generator Draw two circles and a hexagon on the Top viewport Goto Perspective and move one circle up and the hexagon into the space between the circles. Turn on History (Top tool bar) Loft between the 3 curves starting from the bottom Turn off History Manipulate the curves to produce different results. When you change a curve you should see the resulting Lofted form change. Make a copy of the lofted form to the right. Repeat until you have several forms Example 2: Parametric Revolve Generator Draw an interpolated or straight profile curve in the ZX plane in the Front viewport. Goto Perspective and select the curve. Turn on History (Top tool bar) Revolve a full 360 deg around the center axis (Z Up direction) with the curve. This will produce a 3d form. Turn off History Manipulate the control points from the single profile curve to produce different results. To do this, turn on control points with PointsOn (F10) and click to drag. The Gumball feature helps to move objects in a scene. When you change the curve you should see the resulting Revolved form change. Make a copy of the revolved form to the right. Repeat until you have several forms Example 3: Parametric Pipe Generator Draw a curve in the Front viewport. Goto Perspective and manipulate the curve using control points (PointsOn). Turn on History (Top tool bar) Pipe along the curve, setting different radii along the length of the curve. Turn off History Manipulate the curves to produce different results. When you change a curve you should see the resulting Pipe form change. Make a copy of the form to the right. Repeat until you have several forms Example 4: Parametric Surface Generator Draw a curve on the XY plane seen from the Top viewport Goto Perspective viewport and select curve, use PlanarSrf to create a surface. Select the surface and enter Rebuild. Use a U and V division of 10 for each. This will create a dense grid of points on the surface, increasing the number of isocurves. History is enabled by default with this type of surface. Manipulate the control points (PointsOn) to make new forms. Make a copy of the form to the right.

Example 1: Basic Image Sampler Example 2: Basic Attractor Example 3: Vase Builder This example shows a way to implement a Vase or Vessel type design using Grasshopper. The screenshot shown in the repo is rendered using Keyshot . Rendering with Keyshot Keyshot is an entry level rendering tool. It features drag and drop material, color, lighting, environments, and more. Download the 14 day trial to start experimenting. Go through the Keyshot Tutorials to get a basic understanding of the tool and how to use it. Basic Process: Export a 3D model file from CAD (Rhino 3dm, STL, etc) Import into Keyshot Compose the scene Assign materials, lighting, environment, etc Save a screenshot. Depending on how powerful your computer is, you will have to wait longer for better screenshot renders. Tips: The demo doesn't let you save the project file. Save lots of screenshots! Use the \"screenshot\" feature to save decent looking images from the viewport. It saves them into Library/Application Support/Keyshot8/Renderings/ To increase resolution of a screenshot make your window full screen and use the \"Reitna Mode\" feature. Your computer may slow down a bit more doing this but it will give you a higher resolution image in the end. Don't bother with the Render mode since it puts Keyshot watermarks all over the image. The screenshot tool only places a small mark in the bottom left corner (easily removable via Photoshop).

If you feel a bit more comfortable using another CAD tool you may do so as long as you are able to adapt the concepts of parametric modeling to the tool you are using. Explore form finding through the \"factory\" or \"generator\" approach discussed in class (examples above in the course resources). Work iteratively to generate at least 10 variations or instances (outputs) of your parametric design and render them as digital and/or physical objects using any approach you wish. Meaning, you may save STL files out and place them into a Sketchfab viewer, or render using a dedicated render solution such as Keyshot , the Rhino rendering tools , Fusion 360's render workspace , or save screen shots from Rhino (Use the ScreenCaptureToFile command to save screen shots from the viewport). You might also consider 3D printing or laser cutting one or more instances of your design to bring it out of the digital and into physical. Perhaps your final project concept will require digital (rendered) or physical (fabricated) 3D models -- use form finding as a tool to identity interesting forms and shapes that meet your project requirements or design constraints and proceed to create one or more models. Thoughts on getting started: Work through the Rhino notes above from class. Focus on getting comfortable using Rhino to make points, lines, curves, and surfaces using the 2d tools and 3d tools available. Get more familiar with Rhino by working through the Intro to Rhino tutorial in the cm-desgn/rhino folder. Try out all the Rhino commands listed above in the notes. There are many more of course but start with a few and learn how they work. It's best to approach a complex tool like Rhino with a specific goal in mind. Do some research on the idea and you can likely find a tutorial or resource out there that can assist with your idea. Look at related project concepts and attempt to deconstruct them. Use other project ideas as inspiration. Similar to past projects, start and work simply to understand just a few features of the tools available. Don't try to go too far too fast. One can explore this concept of form finding through the manipulation of simple 2d and 3d geometries in combination with the History command. In the process of form finding, think about a set of design constraints your 3d model will achieve. For example, say I design a mug with a parametric hangle on it and the body of the mug is fixed in its width, height, and thickness. What properties of the handle might I consider as parameters (ie. things that can change about the handle geometry)? Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing your form finding explorations. Include recorded video, screen capture, images, audio, or graphics of your generator and its outputs. Attempt to use rendering tools to produce higher fidelity representations of your models. Digital renders can provide context for a design (or idea) through the use of environments, textures and materials, and lighting. Consider adding more details to your videos by adding title screens, talking over the clips, adding music or sound, and using labels or callouts to increase production quality. Talk about the types of tools and software used. Talk about your workflow from initial research and sketches to digital experimentations to physical object(s). Embed the video into your blog post.

We will approach each topic with simplicity in mind and focus on understanding fundamental concepts. To build advanced skills with the tools we discuss you will need to dedicate time outside of class for further experimentation. We will approach topics in a hands-on workshop format so be prepared to dive in. If you do have some web development experience coming into the program think about some new aspects of development you are curious about such as libraries, frameworks, responsiveness, interactivity, animations, Javascript, types of tech stacks, or just how you can improve your skills in what you know through practice. The goal of the weeks ahead is to gain a sense of how you can utilize web technologies to solve problems. Info If you are curious about the history of electronics, computers, computer science, programming, and the Internet, check out the Histories section. I strongly advise you to start getting familiar with the various histories and technological underpinnings of the technologies you use every day. Remember, it's also about building awareness and understanding about the systems that run our world. These resources are meant to work through at your own speed and as you begin to ask deeper questions about why something works and how something works. The World Wide Web What is the World Wide Web, where did it come from, and what is its purpose? The purpose of building websites and web applications is to make an idea accessible to one or more people. How does it work? What is it made of? The Industry What do web developers do? What do web developers need to know? How do you learn web development skills? (HINT: Practice, practice, practice) Languages In the resources here you can find some learning pathways for building skills with these tools. Make time to read through the basics of all the languages and try things out. Most importantly, seek to apply the skills you are learning towards projects. HTML / Learning HTML & CSS CSS Javascript / Learning Javascript Development Environment Lets get started by setting up a development environment. The most basic things you need for any web development tasks are a text editor and a browser like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Other tools such as the Terminal, Git, Github, and Node.js enable you to work with all sorts of libraries and frameworks, collaborate with others, and quickly prototype new ideas. All these tools come together under the idea of running a \"local development server\" or localhost on your machine. Text Editors TextEdit - Default editor on MacOS ASCII vs Binary Files Atom - Free editor by Github Atom Packages / My Atom Setup Visual Studio Code (VSCode) - Free editor by Microsoft. My editor of choice. Terminal How I use terminal (preferences, themes, .bash_profile, aliases, etc) Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app Learning Terminal - Cheetsheets and more! Github - Website that hosts git repositories. Learning how to use version control systems such as Git and Github enable many people to collaborate. Learning Git - A great place to start learning about Git and Github. Local Development Server There are several ways to work with a local web server. Some are simpler than others to setup and configure. For our purposes we will often use a Node.js based live-server environment, which is really just a node module ( npm ) running on the Node.js Javascript framework. Its mostly a matter of personal or project preference which local web server option you use, if any. Sometimes development is done on a remote server (ie. AWS) or a combo of local and remote. How to Build a Sandbox - Short tutorial showing how to setup a flexible local development environment using Node.js. Examples of using live-server can be found at: cm-code/live-servers . Chrome Browser Chrome Dev Tools (Inspector for debugging). Access via: View > Developer > Developer Tools within Chrome. Terminal, Git, and Github Terminal Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app How do you display hidden files on MacOS? Look here Customize your Terminal in Terminal > Preferences. It helps to make the text larger on most screens. Common commands: cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm, mv, cp, pwd, man, touch . Think of all these commands as tiny applications that have no GUI. They are very old and have been around since the start of Unix based systems (Read this to learn more: Looking back at OS X's origins ). Look at MacOS/Linux/Unix Command Line Cheat Sheet to see more information about common commands. Working with directories and files: cd <folder> - Goto into a folder cd .. - Go up one level cd ../<folder> - Go up one level (to parent folder) and into a child folder cd ../.. - Go up two levels etc Tab completion - When you start typing in a terminal you can hit tab to complete the command if the file or folder you are going to use is available. If you hit Tab twice, you will see the contents of a folder. How to Setup Git You will likely not have Git installed on your machine. You will know if you have it or not when you type git into the Terminal. You may be prompted to install XCode Developer Tools in doing so. You have two options to install git: Install the XCode Developer tools (easy way) or download the installer from git-scm . After installing it the git command should work in the Terminal. How to Use Github Register for an account on Github. ( Stuck on choosing a username? Read this. A Tale of Github Usernames ) Create a repo on Github . If you check the box to add a README file it will include a README.md file in the repo. This is the main information file shown when you goto the repo URL. Markdown = text file with special syntax that gets converted into HTML. Review Markdown Cheatsheet . Clone Repo: git clone <repo url> . For Example, git clone git@github.com:rjduran/cm-sandbox.git . Note the URL and its use of \"git\" or \"https\". Use \"https\" to start. You need to go through the Github tutorial below to connect to Github via SSH. Make some changes: (Using text editor of some kind - Atom, VSCode, TextEdit) Stage the changes: git add index.html Commit the changes: git commit -m \"my message describing changes\" Push the changes: git push Pro tip: After setting up your Github account, read through Connecting to Github with SSH to setup your system to connect securely to Github and not require you to enter your username and password credentials each time you push changes. In Class Exercises Opening files in browser Setup a folder and create an index.html file in it. Insert some html and css code and reload in browser to view the changes. Repeat Using a local development server Setup local dev server (localhost). Insert some html and css code and watch the page change in browser automagically (because of live-server). Repeat Deconstructing Websites Look at a website you think is interesting. Using the Chrome development tools, inspect the site. Look at the page elements, the overall structure of the html, css, and js. Get familiar with the deveelopment tools interface / console. If you are more comfortable in Photoshop or Illustrator, take screenshots of the website and lay them out to annotate. Put screenshots on a layer and annotations on another layer. You could even use wireframe tools or hand sketch out the structure of pages and label elements by tag. Start matching up the page elements with HTML tags - h1, h2, p, li, a, div, etc. (Tip: Look at W3 Schools HTML Element Reference )","title":"Week 4: Terminal, Intro to Web Development"},{"location":"APRD-5005/#assignment-3-intro-to-web-development","text":"The goal of this week is to get familiar with a variety of web development tools and skills. You will work with HTML/CSS to build a simple webpage, you will choose a website to deconstruct, and you will get familar with the Terminal. You should also have a basic understanding of how to use Git and Github to commit and push files to a repository and pull or clone files from a repository on Github. These aspects of development will be used throughout the rest of the class so you there will be many chances to practice. This assignment has 3 parts: Part 1: Setup your local development environment We will work through some of these items in class. If you get stuck, look at the notes above, ask a neighbor, or send a message via slack. With this setup you should be able to protoype any kind of website or web app locally via live-server running in the Terminal and browser. (Hint: Work through this tutorial to complete Part 1. How to Build a Sandbox ) Install a Text Editor Install Git Install Node.js Install live-server (npm) Open Browser and goto http://127.0.0.1:8080/ Part 2: Deconstruct a website Choose a 1-2 pages of a website to deconstruct and analyze it to the best of your abilities. For this exercise, just focus on the HTML elements of the pages. Optional: If you want to go a step further, attempt to deconstruct the styles and javscript used in the page too. The purpose of this is to gain an understanding of what a developer does to translate web designs or wireframes into functional code. Utilize tools such as the Chrome development tools and an annotation method to describe the overall structure of a page. Annotate HTML elements with text labels over screenshots of the website, wireframes, or hand sketches. Embed your annotated images into your blog post with a brief writeup of your process and outcomes. Part 3: Ode to Things Choose one (or more) every day object(s) in your life and make a simple website for it / them. You might consider the site as a container for a favored item or collection of things, a product to sell, or simply a site that pays tribute to the item or object and what it means to you in life. This idea was inspired by the website Ode to Things , which is an e-commerce store and curated collection of physical every day products. Example code from class: lime-cat Build a webpage from scratch that makes use of html elements and css selectors. Use necessary html elements that act as containers for different types of content and page heirarchy: text, images, video, etc. Develop your webpage using your local development environment setup in Part 1. When done, make a repository on Github for your project and commit the index.html and any media files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result. Deliverable: A 1-2 min video screen capture demonstrating your local development environment as setup in Part 1 and your webpage built in Part 3. Embed the video into your blog post. Tip If you are new to screen capture tools, look into using Screencast-o-matic to document your workflow. Create an account with Youtube or Vimeo if necessary and upload your video. Note: MacOS (Mojave) has a built in screen recorder tool with key command Shift + Command + 5. Include a link to your Github repo for the code written in Part 3 in your blog post. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about web development and the tools used? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio before our next class.

What is Pseudocode? - TLDW; It's logic written out in plain english that you then translate into the programming language of choice. Blockly - A visual programming framework based on the famous Scratch project by the Lifelong Kindergarden group at the MIT Media Lab. Q: How can I get better at programming / thinking / making / problem solving this way? The short and honest answer is that it takes lots of practice. Look to solve as many problems as you can using programming (and in the process practice computational thinking). It takes an interest and willingness to jump into new tools and code on the regular. Try out as many different languages, libraries and frameworks as you can that address the problems of interest. Read books. Read / work through tutorials and examples. Watch videos. Solve problems. Think about what kind of learner you are and how you navigate resources when learning new skills. Start with the resources in Learning Javascript . Related to the above discussion about programming and such, here are a few things to read if you are concerned with needing to have a strong background in math to accomplish anything with Javascript or another programming language. I hope this also addresses the question of \"What amount and kind of math would you need to use to improve as a programmer?\" And I use the word \"improve\" because its a practice like other forms of making and creativity. Which takes time to practice and master. You Don't Have to Be Good at Math to Learn to Code Learning to code: do I need to be good at maths? \"How much math do I need to know to program?\"\" Not That Much, Actually. Does Math Help Programming Or Programming Help Math? Intro to Javascript JavaScript is a programming language for the web. It makes things dynamic, interactive, and fun! Question: When should Javascript be used? I hope some of these articles begin to paint the picture of why and when you would use Javascript. You Know You Should Use JavaScript When\u2026 The Five Top Reasons to Use JavaScript When do developers use JavaScript and why? Choosing Programming Languages: The Right Tool For The Job (C#, Python, Node.js) Question: How to use JS with HTML / CSS?

Stackoverflow Discussion on Pros and Cons Embedded vs Linked (ie. JS code inside a script tag or in a linked script.js file). Linked: <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"script.js\"></script> Question: How can I work interactively with JS and within the browser? The best way to start experimenting with JS is to play with it in an sandbox or local development environment, like what you setup last week using the live-server npm module. Chrome Developer Tools > Console and console.log() are your best friend when debugging JS code. Think of this statement as a way to put your code and the way it functions under the microscope when the browser runs it. How To Use the JavaScript Developer Console - A great intro tutorial explaining how and why to use the console. DOM (Document Object Model) The DOM is a standard object model and programming interface created by the browser when a webpage is loaded. It is essentially your HTML page but in a different format now accessible through a browser based programming interface and language (Javascript). In general, JS can manipulate (get, change, add, delete) any part of the DOM (ie. any part of a page or document). Here's a great image of the DOM DOM Tree Visualization Example on CodePen Try opening the Chrome Developer Console and typing document or window . What does it return? How does it relate to the DOM image above? JavaScript DOM Tutorial Series (Video Playlist) - A great series of videos introducing the DOM and how to manipulate it with Javascript. It totals 2 hrs in duration but is extremely helpful to understand some aspects of the Javascript language and how it can be used. Eloquent Javascript: CH 14 - The Document Object Model Some things you can use JS for: Change / Remove HTML elements in the DOM / on the page Change and add CSS styles to elements Read and change element attributes (href, src, alt, and more) Create new HTML elements and insert them into the DOM / page Attach event listeners to elements (click, keypress, submit) Send/Request data to/from an API Language Fundamentals Javascript is a programming language that while it has an abundance of learning resources freely available on the web it still takes years to master for most people. Try not to feel discouraged since you are likely new to programming and understanding the various aspects of web development. As with most programming languages and tools for building the web, always start by seeking out documentation and resources on the subject. I have several books listed in the Learning JS section. Most of them are good entry points. Additionally, every programming language that is widely used will have some kind of language reference with examples of how to use it. Many can be copied and pasted into the console or script to run. Below are some resources pointing at aspects of the Javascript language. Language Overviews Javascript for Cats is an entertaining overview that covers the most important parts of the language. Javascript Basics (p5.js wiki) is a quick-ish overview of the language and how to use it with or without p5.js .

Part 1 is required but Part 2 is optional. I highly encourage you to work through part 2 because it will further your understanding of how to work with the language in the browser. This assignment has 2 parts: Part 1: JS Examples Research 2-3 examples of Javascript in action. Look at the resources above and investigate uses of JS that interest you. Try to identify what the JS is doing behaviorally when you interact with it or by observing its dynamic behavior in a page. Attempt to identify libraries (if any) that are used to build the functionality you see and interact with. Javascript is so versatile that at times it might be difficult to decipher from simply looking at the behavior in the browser. You have to dig into the Developer Tools and inspect beyond the page elements and into the files that are being downloaded from the server (Hint: Look in the Network tab within the Developer Tools). let me google that for you...

To get started: Clone cm-javascripting and start up a live-server in the \"starter\" directory. With live-server running, open the Chrome Developer tools Console and enter: document . You will get a representation of the entire HTML document as an object. The document object is the top level object in the DOM. Read through this list of Properties and Methods for the document object and to understand what you can see in the console. Use this as a reference for the following challenges. Watch the videos 1-5 in this tutorial series to get a sense of how to complete the following challenges. Console Basics: Tip: As you type code into the developer console be careful not to reload the page or you will wipe out what is in the console. To keep a backup of the Javascript entered just make a temporary .txt or .js file and copy and paste your code. You can follow along in this video for console basics. Open the Developer Console and type document . Define an integer variable: var a = 1; Define a string variable: var name = \"Your Name\"; Define an array that stores numbers: 1,3,5,7,9 Define a function called \"helloWorld\" that prints \"Hello World\" to the console when called. Defing a function called \"printName\" that prints out your name when called; Define a function that prints any name entered as parameter when called. What happens when you overwrite an existing function? DOM Basics: Getting Elements Get a reference to all the paragraph (p) tags in the document. Hint: Look at getElementsByTagName() Get a reference to a paragraph tag with a specific id of \"second\". Hint: Look at getElementById() Get a reference to a all paragraph tags with a class of \"first\". Hint: Look at getElementsByClassName() Get a reference to an element or elements within another element. For example, if you have an unordered list (ul) with several list items (li), how do you select a specific li and display it's contents to the console? Change the active color of the sidebar to red. Changing Elements Change the text within a sidebar list item (li) to \"Foo\". Change the text within the previously selected list item (li) to \"Greetings List Item! I'm a string from another planet!\". Change the text of a specific paragraph to a different string of text. Use an Ipsum generator tool to create new placeholder text that you insert using Javascript. Removing Elements Clear the contents of the paragraph with an id of \"empty-me\". Clear the contents of the set of paragraphs with class \"empty-us\". Remove the div with a specific id of \"section3\". Adding Elements Create a new anchor tag that links to your blog and insert it just after the paragraph tag in the div with an id of \"about\". Append a new div anywhere in the document and give it an id of your choice. Insert a paragraph with some content into the div using javascript. Add a new list item to the sidebar ul that links to your new div so you can click and scroll to it. Add a new list item with URL to www.google.com in the sidebar. Event Listeners Make an event listener for any h2 element that triggers an alert() when you click it. Set the alert message to \"Hey Hey Hey!\". Make an event listener that triggers a change in the text of a specific paragraph with the id \"change-me\". Deliverable: A 1-2 min video screen capture showing the examples you researched in Part 1.

Choose from the list above or locate something else and explore it. My suggestion for exploring something visual / dynamic / interactive is to start with P5.js . If you want to dig deeper into making something more practical as a website experience with common UI elements then look into jQuery and jQueryUI and Bootstrap to start. If you are feeling like you want to delve into the world of Node.js, Three.js, or AFrame, check out the resources on the left sidebar. Thoughts on getting started: If you have a web based project in mind for your final project or another project, begin to identify what tools you might use to build that project and attempt to work on a piece of it. What functionalites does the project need? (Maybe there's a library for it) How do you see the project working from the user experience? What design elements can you identify and how might they be coded? Make a list of questions you have about the interactive and/or dynamic behaviour observed on websites you have visited and are inspired by. What's intriguing to you about the websites and how they work? Investigate libraries that seem interesting to you. Assess their capabilities and how you can apply it to a project. Try to be as specific as possible when invesitgating a library or framework. What is your motivation for learning it and what do you want to accomplish with it? Identify some specific uses of it and focus. Start simple. Dont try to understand it all. If you copy and paste code from somewhere, copy one line at a time and learn what it does. Then add more code and repeat. It's easier to start simply and build up complex functionlaity than to work the other way. Look for \"getting started\" documentation about a library or framework.

This term is synonymous with \"Arduino\" since its the programming language used. We're moving on to look at electronics, hardware, and looking at how we design interactive systems with it. What is Physical Computing? Physical Computing is an approach to computer-human interaction design that starts by considering how humans express themselves physically. Computer interface design instruction often takes the computer hardware for given \u2014 namely, that there is a keyboard, a screen, speakers, and a mouse or trackpad or touchscreen \u2014 and concentrates on teaching the software necessary to design within those boundaries. In physical computing, we take the human body and its capabilities as the starting point, and attempt to design interfaces, both software and hardware, that can sense and respond to what humans can physically do. This means that we have to learn how a computer converts the changes in energy given off by our bodies, in the form of heat, light, sound, and so forth, into changing electronic signals that it can be read and interpreted by computers. In physical computing, this is accomplished by connecting sensors to the simplest of computers, called microcontrollers, in order to read these changes and interpret them as actions. Within the microcontroller, custom software acts as the behaviour or control logic driving a variety of digital and physical outputs such as graphics, light, motion, and sound. Source 1: Adapted from \"What is Physical Computing?\" by Tom Igoe (ITP, NYU) Source 2: Intro to Physical Computing Slides by Danny Rozin (ITP, NYU) First, some fun examples... There's no lack of interesting projects out there at this time (2019). The field of physical computing has been evolving since the introduction of the Arduino in 2005. Circula WePlug Dripping Machine for Ceramics Minimalist Greeting Robot Rot Bot Pacman Costumes Face Trade Arduino (what? why?) Arduino is an open-source hardware and software platform for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical and digital world. Inputs (Sensors) -> Behavior (Software) -> Outputs (Action) You can think about this type of device (microcontroller) as the interface between the physical and digital world. It allows you to translate physical phenomena into digital information and act upon it with software (code) to produce a kind of digital or physical output such as flashing a light or turning a motor. The Arduino and connected devices can be thought of as hardware \"LEGOS\" or building blocks to construct complex electro-mechanical, interactive, and responsive systems.

Look for a guide such as the Arduino Comparison Guide by Sparkfun to start. Decide what your project will do and what inputs and outputs it has. Also take into consideration how you plan to use the Arduino. Does it use data from the physical world? Does it need to display information? Do you need all the features available in the board or can you get away with a smaller/cheaper/less capable one? How much do you have to spend on the project? Look at the cost of supplies.

Explore creative uses of the input and out device(s) you choose to work with. From class we know that buttons cause some kind of action to happen. What\u2019s the action you wish to design for? We also know that LEDs are a common response from systems that need to communicate its status, its state, or its mode of operation -- they are used to signal us in some way. They are used in many situations to tell us something through color, brightness, pulsing, state changes, and light. What will your system communicate through the use of an LED as an output device? Some examples / use cases to build from: Timers - push a button, start timer on screen or visible through changing LED colors Alarms - push button, set alarm, turn on LED when time is up Light Sequence - push a button or initiate a sequence of events, begin light sequence(s) You are welcome to explore other input and output devices such as environmental sensors (temperature, etc), servo motors, and relays to create a project with more functionality if you wish. You may also explore the use of the Processing environment as an output device or input device. Examples of this could be to change the color of a Processing sketch in response to a physical button press or knob turning plugged into an Arduino or an LED changing color in response to a set of swatch colors being chosen in a Processing sketch. To look at how serial communication works in this way you will want to investigate the examples shown under the Arduino + Processing section in the cm-arduino repo.

These 4 examples are the building blocks of many kinds of projects. Each example has pictures of how to build the circuit. Replicate the circuit exactly as you see it and read the notes for each to understand more about it. Next move on to understanding how the examples in cm-arduino work starting with RGB_LED_01. Here's a video of the examples hooked up and working . Dont try to go too far too fast. Take your time to connect wires to the correct locations on a bread board. You will likely need to hook circuits up a few times to get something working. Make sure you upload the correct Arduino sketch. The board you use may contain a previous sketch in memory when you first start to use it. Its good practice to \"reflash\" the Arduino with an empty sketch just to be sure it's not running another program that could cause issues with hardware you are wiring up. If you encounter what seems like a hardware issue or strange behavior, you might have something hooked up incorrectly or maybe even missing a connection. Double check the circuit diagram and retrace your steps. Work together! Have fun with it! Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing what you made. Include recorded video of your hardware working as designed and screen shots or photos of specific moments of interest you encounter and wish to communicate in the project development. Talk about the types of input and output devices used, interactions you designed for, what you learned, and what your goals were. Embed the video into your blog post. Draw a circuit diagram of your project using Fritzing and insert it into your blog post. Note: This tool is used to make the circuit diagrams shown on every Arduino example page. Create a github repo for this assignment to document the code you created. If you built something that makes use of both Arduino and Processing be sure to include folders for both types of sketches.

So...How is this different from an Arduino? There are so many differences and many similarities but ultimately it comes down to understanding what each type of board is (how we classify it), what it is good and bad at (pros and cons), and what it offers given the parameters of a project. I also like this human based analogy from a user in the Quora thread - \"What are the differences between Arduino and Raspberry Pi?\" . Arduino is like the spinal cord. It connects to a large number of peripherals and provides spontaneous communication. Good for low-intelligence tasks. Raspberry Pi is like the brain. Its primary advantage comes in processing higher level processing capability.

The task this week is to dive into the world of single-board micro-computers by making something with the Raspberry Pi. \"With\" being the keyword here. You could take it to mean \"build a system with the device as the platform running code to perform some action\" similar to working with an Arduino or you might consider just using the Raspberry Pi environment to try out a new piece of software running on it and have the goal of making something using the built-in tools available. Tools such as Mathematica or Sonic-Pi come preinstalled on the full desktop version of Raspbian. You might even consider exploring an alternative operating system or \"disk image\" that does something more specialized out of the box like retropi or openframe . Ways to engage: You are welcome to approach this weeks assignment solo or with a partner. I recommend working together regardless. It's a great way to troubleshoot / motivate / question / learn. If you dont know where to start, begin by making a list of questions about possible uses of the technology that matter to you. In what ways will you engage with it? What's clear about it? Whats confusing about it? What do you know about it? Whats mysterious? What's its purpose? Why use it? Then attempt to answer those questions. Make a map. Similar to what I shared in class, make a map to tease out some understanding about the technology and it's place in the world. Where do you engage with it? For what purpose? To what end or final cause ? If you found some success using Arduino's and input/output devices, and feel confident enough trying out another platform in this way, consider working through some tutorials about how to make the Raspberry Pi perform similar tasks. Then look at what else it can do that's different from an Arduino. Start simple just as you would on an Arduino. For example, here's a tutorial on a Blink example similar to Blink on Arduino. Focus on a feature. For example, make something that uses bluetooth functionality for connectivity and sharing data. Bluetooth speakers, headphones, and smart devices all use bluetooth to share data. If you are interested in the deployment of this device as a webserver providing static content and/or connected to hardware, check out the W3 tutorial on Node.js and Raspberry Pi . Look at projects and tutorials!! Use the resources above and the Google machine to find some projects or tutorials that interest you. Follow them and identify what works and what doesn't. What's intriguing about it? How easy or difficult is the project to build? How easy are the instructions to follow? What if you were to write up or document your project in a similar way? How would you do it? Working with this tool may require learning something about new programming languages to realize an idea or run a bit of code someone previously made open-source. Try it out and see what happens. Locate a good resource (book, website, series of tutorials) to learn enough of the programming language to understand how to run the code. Something working thw wrong way is better than nothing always. Ways of connecting to and use a Raspberry Pi device: By connecting up a display, mouse, and keybaord to the Pi USB ports. This is by far the easiest but requires the peripherials. In the terminal via SSH and ip address. For example, ssh pi@192.168.0.25 . This is the command line interface (CLI) approach. Be sure to use with your correct IP address for the device. Using a desktop VNC tool to see the desktop environment of Raspbian running on the Pi. For example, VNC Viewer . To transfer files back and forth on any connected device you can use an FTP/SFTP tool like Cyberduck or the built in command line tools such as scp in terminal. Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing what you made. Include recorded video, screen capture, images, audio, or graphics of your explorations working. Include screen shots or photos of specific moments of interest you encounter and wish to communicate in the project development. Consider adding more details to your videos by talking over the clips, adding music or sound, and using labels or callouts to increase production quality. Talk about the types of tools and software used, input and output devices used, interactions or behaviours you designed for, what you learned, and what your goals of the project were. Embed the video into your blog post. (Optional) If needed, draw a circuit diagram of your project using Fritzing and insert it into your blog post. (Optional) Create a github repo for any code used in this assignment. Include a link to your repo for the code written in your blog post. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience.

This is our trajectory for the next 3 weeks. Digital Design (aka CAD) A short history of sketching and blueprints. What happened before computers? Vintage Photos: Life Before AutoCAD What is CAD and why do we use it to make things? What kinds of things are possible with CAD? ( Hint: Look around. What do you see? Almost everything in our human built environment is made using an industrialized CAD/CAM process. ) CAD Tools 2D - Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, etc 3D - Fusion 360, Autocad, Inventor, Solidworks, Rhino, etc Digital Fabrication (aka CAM) Digital fabrication is a type of manufacturing process where the machine used is controlled by a computer. The most common forms of digital fabrication are CNC Machining, Laser Cutting, and 3D Printing. ( Source: Open Desk ), Google Search , Digital Fabrication Pintrest Board by Naz\u0131m Da\u011fdeviren CAD -> CAM CAD = Computer-Aided Design Input: Idea for 3D model; Output: 3D model and instructions for CAM. CAM = Computer-Aided Manufacturing Input: Toolpath file / instructions; Output: Physical Object Typical Digital Design to Physical Production Workflow Step 1: Design with one or more CAD tools for the desired production method(s). Step 2: Fabricate by hand (ie. cut, carve, bend, sand, etc), with manually controlled machines (ie. Mill, Lathe, Saw, Drill, etc), with Computer Numerically Controlled Machines (ie. CNC Mill, CNC Router, 3D Printer, Laser Cutter, Plasma Cutter, Water Jet Cutter, etc) or some combination of all methods. In general, most workflows consist of a series of steps where specific tools and knowledge are put into action to complete the step and move to the next step in the process. In terms of digital to physical workflows, we're always dealing with data in some form / file format. Its good practice to get familiar with input and output formats for any CAD tool you work with because you then know what the tool is capable of and how other tools can interface with it. Most CAD environments can work with a variety of 3D file formats such as .STL, .OBJ, .STEP, and many others. 3D Meshes A polygon mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object in 3D computer graphics and solid modeling. The faces usually consist of triangles (triangle mesh), quadrilaterals (quads), or other simple convex polygons (n-gons), since this simplifies rendering, but may also be more generally composed of concave polygons, or even polygons with holes.

CAD How do you prepare a design and print it? Use a Slicer tool to produce GCODE needed by printer. See below. What kinds of materials are used? PLA or ABS are the most common. What kind of printing process should I use? It depends on the thing you want to make, how much you want to spend on it, and the material you want/need to use. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most common and cheapest. Additive Manufacturing Technologies (Image) , Source: 3D Hubs Slicing for 3D Printing Slicing tools convert a 3D mesh (STL) into GCODE to run the printer. This is not to be confused with the Autodesk tool - \"[Slicer for Fusion 360]( Slicer for Fusion 360 \". That is a tool for converting 3D models into 2D pieces that can be cut on a laser cutter with 2D sheet material to assemble into a 3D model after. Cura is what we use for the Ultimaker 3. Slicing Process Load STL file into Cura Choose PLA material for Extruder 1 and PVA for Extruder 2 (If using support material) Choose a print profile (aka Layer Height: Start with Fast or Normal options) Choose an infill (Density) Save GCODE file and copy to USB drive Designing for Laser Cutting How do you design a 3d model to laser cut? CAD. Use a CAD tool to design in 3D and convert a 3D shape into 2D pieces. Sometimes this step requies specialized software. See below. How do you prepare a design and laser cut it? Use a vector graphics tool like AI to layout file and assign color mapping. This is how the system will know what machine settings to use for the paths in your file. What kinds of materials are used? Sheet material - Paper, wood, cardboard, plastics. What methods can you use to make a 3D object out of flat 2D sheet material? Look at examples in Slicer for Fusion 360. More advanced versions of these techniques are referenced in the resources below and mostly use Rhino + Grasshopper to implement.

Alternative method: Use the DXF exporting script here for exporting many named sketches. Layout the DXF file in Adobe Illustrator or another vector graphics or CAD program in preparation for laser cutting. Assign colors to paths for vector cutting (red stroke), vector scoring (blue stroke), and raster engraving (black fill). The color mapping will depend on the system used.

I highly recommend you use the 3D printers and laser cutter at the Idea Forge to complete this assignment. Note this assignment will take time to design, fabricate, and assemble so get started asap. Also, note the Idea Forge does NOT have weekend hours for printing and using the laser. For 3D Printing: You may utilize the printer in our studio if you have walked through it with me or another student. There is currently a limited amount of material and only 1 machine in our studio so I advise you to purchase a roll of PLA filament if you would like to print something larger than 2-3 in or in a specific color. Gizmodorks or Amazon are great places to find a roll of 3.0 mm PLA filament. They are around $20-$30 for a 2.2kg roll. You could even share the cost with others. Pay attention to the size of your model and print times. For Laser Cutting: You can use the system at the Idea Forge once you have files prepared. In general, you will need to have a vector graphics file in .AI, .DXF, or .EPS to interface with their system. I assume most people use Adobe Illustrator and can create a file for this purpose. The Idea Forge has an Epilog Fusion 40 machine with a bed size of 40 x 28 in. Setup an Artboard in Illustrator to this size as we did in class. For materials, start with 3 mm or approx 1/8\" thick cardboard and design to these specifications. Always check with the Idea Forge staff on correct protocols for printing and laser cutting. Thoughts on getting started: Sketch out on paper something original that addresses a need. Do you need a case for your Arduino or Raspberry Pi based project? Determine the specifications for your case and draw it in CAD. Hint: Look for tutorials on this. There are alot. Explore one or more digital fabrication methods (contouring, triangulation, waffle, unrolling geometry, or some combination of these) and produce a physical instance of it. For example, you might have a 3d model that you would like to produce at large scale. Larger than might be possible in a single 3d print within a reasonable amount of time. What method would you use to produce your model? What if the model were triangulated? Or contoured? What material would you choose? What steps need to be taken in the digital domain to translate into components that can be produced and assembled physically? Analyze and recreate an existing product or object you find interesting Maybe you have a final project idea that requires physical parts? Can they be printed or laser cut? Do you have any product ideas? What method of manufacture might work to make them tangible? Explore some of the resources listed for 3D printing. Look through the design guides below and seek out additional resources to aid your design process. As with most ideas turned into CAD models, I suggest start by hand sketching your ideas out. Think about the problem you wish to solve or the questions you have around whats possible with this tool / medium / material. Think about the forms you want to model, the parts you want to use in an assembly, the mechanical movements you wish to explore, etc. Don't let the tools or process get in the way of you producing an instance of your idea. Start simple and make many iterations until you get to something that communicates your intent. Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing what you made. Include recorded video, screen capture, images, audio, or graphics of your explorations working.

While it is possible to utilize Fusion 360 in similar ways through User Parameters and python scripting (via Fusion 360 API), it really is a different design paradigm and I encourage you to explore it. This toolset will be our primary environment for Spring 2020 course APRD-5017: Parametric Product Design. As time allows, we will look at making quick renders using Keyshot. Rhino & Grasshopper Overview What is Rhino? Rhino is a CAD tool for designers and architects. It's considered one of the standard 3d modeling tools for product designers across many different industries. Rhino Download for macOS - Free for 90 days. Edu License available for ~$90 @ CU Bookstore. Rhinoceros will be in your Applications folder after install. What is Grasshopper ? Grasshopper is an node-based algorithmic modeling environment plugin for Rhino. As of Rhino 6.0 it's included when you install. You access it by typing Grasshopper into the command interface in Rhino. When you launch the tool it will open a separate window that overlays the Rhino window. Just position Rhino on half of your screen and Grasshopper on the other half. Old Grasshopper Website / Forum Current Grasshopper Forum Google Search: Rhino Grasshopper Rhino for Windows vs Rhino for macOS Rhino for Windows is much older than Rhino for macOS and therefore contains a bit more functionality (for now). There are many open-source and proprietary plugins available for both Rhino and Grasshopper but not all are compatible for both operating systems yet. To get something to work the way you want, you sometimes need to use both OSes. Grasshopper on Mac Component Compatibility Testing : Components Rhino 6 for Windows commands not in Rhino 6 for Mac Whats possible with Rhino + Grasshopper? Why use them? There are many design oriented or industry specific reasons but one BIG reason to use the tool is for its extendability through plugins (food4Rhino) for both Rhino and Grasshopper. Plugins such as Grasshopper enable all sorts of design possibilities in computational design, parametric design , and generative design . Parametric Design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.

This means to work iteratively to explore a form making process where the designer changes features of the system to produce a family of different results. This process takes advantage of the History command to associate recorded parameters to each other, which is a characteristic of Parametric Modeling as done naturally in Fusion 360 and further enabled through Grasshopper. The following examples are in the cm-design/rhino folder. Example 1: Parametric Loft Generator Draw two circles and a hexagon on the Top viewport Goto Perspective and move one circle up and the hexagon into the space between the circles. Turn on History (Top tool bar) Loft between the 3 curves starting from the bottom Turn off History Manipulate the curves to produce different results. When you change a curve you should see the resulting Lofted form change. Make a copy of the lofted form to the right. Repeat until you have several forms Example 2: Parametric Revolve Generator Draw an interpolated or straight profile curve in the ZX plane in the Front viewport. Goto Perspective and select the curve. Turn on History (Top tool bar) Revolve a full 360 deg around the center axis (Z Up direction) with the curve. This will produce a 3d form. Turn off History Manipulate the control points from the single profile curve to produce different results. To do this, turn on control points with PointsOn (F10) and click to drag. The Gumball feature helps to move objects in a scene. When you change the curve you should see the resulting Revolved form change. Make a copy of the revolved form to the right. Repeat until you have several forms Example 3: Parametric Pipe Generator Draw a curve in the Front viewport. Goto Perspective and manipulate the curve using control points (PointsOn). Turn on History (Top tool bar) Pipe along the curve, setting different radii along the length of the curve. Turn off History Manipulate the curves to produce different results. When you change a curve you should see the resulting Pipe form change. Make a copy of the form to the right. Repeat until you have several forms Example 4: Parametric Surface Generator Draw a curve on the XY plane seen from the Top viewport Goto Perspective viewport and select curve, use PlanarSrf to create a surface. Select the surface and enter Rebuild. Use a U and V division of 10 for each. This will create a dense grid of points on the surface, increasing the number of isocurves. History is enabled by default with this type of surface. Manipulate the control points (PointsOn) to make new forms. Make a copy of the form to the right.

The screenshot shown in the repo is rendered using Keyshot . Rendering with Keyshot Keyshot is an entry level rendering tool. It features drag and drop material, color, lighting, environments, and more. Download the 14 day trial to start experimenting. Go through the Keyshot Tutorials to get a basic understanding of the tool and how to use it. Basic Process: Export a 3D model file from CAD (Rhino 3dm, STL, etc) Import into Keyshot Compose the scene Assign materials, lighting, environment, etc Save a screenshot. Depending on how powerful your computer is, you will have to wait longer for better screenshot renders. Tips: The demo doesn't let you save the project file. Save lots of screenshots! Use the \"screenshot\" feature to save decent looking images from the viewport. It saves them into Library/Application Support/Keyshot8/Renderings/ To increase resolution of a screenshot make your window full screen and use the \"Reitna Mode\" feature. Your computer may slow down a bit more doing this but it will give you a higher resolution image in the end. Don't bother with the Render mode since it puts Keyshot watermarks all over the image. The screenshot tool only places a small mark in the bottom left corner (easily removable via Photoshop).

If you feel a bit more comfortable using another CAD tool you may do so as long as you are able to adapt the concepts of parametric modeling to the tool you are using. Explore form finding through the \"factory\" or \"generator\" approach discussed in class (examples above in the course resources). Work iteratively to generate at least 10 variations or instances (outputs) of your parametric design and render them as digital and/or physical objects using any approach you wish. Meaning, you may save STL files out and place them into a Sketchfab viewer, or render using a dedicated render solution such as Keyshot , the Rhino rendering tools , Fusion 360's render workspace , or save screen shots from Rhino (Use the ScreenCaptureToFile command to save screen shots from the viewport). You might also consider 3D printing or laser cutting one or more instances of your design to bring it out of the digital and into physical. Perhaps your final project concept will require digital (rendered) or physical (fabricated) 3D models -- use form finding as a tool to identity interesting forms and shapes that meet your project requirements or design constraints and proceed to create one or more models. Thoughts on getting started: Work through the Rhino notes above from class. Focus on getting comfortable using Rhino to make points, lines, curves, and surfaces using the 2d tools and 3d tools available. Get more familiar with Rhino by working through the Intro to Rhino tutorial in the cm-desgn/rhino folder. Try out all the Rhino commands listed above in the notes. There are many more of course but start with a few and learn how they work. It's best to approach a complex tool like Rhino with a specific goal in mind. Do some research on the idea and you can likely find a tutorial or resource out there that can assist with your idea. Look at related project concepts and attempt to deconstruct them. Use other project ideas as inspiration. Similar to past projects, start and work simply to understand just a few features of the tools available. Don't try to go too far too fast. One can explore this concept of form finding through the manipulation of simple 2d and 3d geometries in combination with the History command. In the process of form finding, think about a set of design constraints your 3d model will achieve. For example, say I design a mug with a parametric hangle on it and the body of the mug is fixed in its width, height, and thickness. What properties of the handle might I consider as parameters (ie. things that can change about the handle geometry)? Deliverables: A 2-3 min video showing your form finding explorations. Include recorded video, screen capture, images, audio, or graphics of your generator and its outputs. Attempt to use rendering tools to produce higher fidelity representations of your models. Digital renders can provide context for a design (or idea) through the use of environments, textures and materials, and lighting. Consider adding more details to your videos by adding title screens, talking over the clips, adding music or sound, and using labels or callouts to increase production quality. Talk about the types of tools and software used. Talk about your workflow from initial research and sketches to digital experimentations to physical object(s). Embed the video into your blog post. Export mesh (STL Files) of your model and upload them to Sketchfab . Embed the viewer into your bog post. In this case perhaps you combine all the models created into a single viewer or multiple viewers for many instances. (Optional) Physical model(s). Bring all models produced to class. Take photos of completed models and put them in your documentation. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about parametric design?

IMD Learning Resources \u00b6 This course will make use of various kinds of media such as books, websites, technical documentation, and video tutorials spanning interaction design, game engines, programming / scripting, computer graphics, and hardware systems used to construct immersive media based experiences. While some resources will be listed under the week we encounter them, most of the primary learning resources can be found listed in the Learning Resources section of the IMD Setup Guide . Course Repo \u00b6 You will be able to find the examples we talk about in class here. Course Repo: CM2-IMD Workload \u00b6 This is a 3 credit hour course. You should expect to dedicate at least 2-3 hours per credit hour. This translates into a 6-9 hours per week. Consider 6 hours a minimum expectation for one studio course and plan accordingly with your other studio courses. Deliverables for the course consist of \" Looking Outwards \" Reports, Workouts , Assignments , and a Final Project . These are to be submitted weekly as blog posts on the due date specified each week. In general, assignment parameters will be based on the topics of the week and due the following week by the start of class time. Refer to the Deliverables section for more detail. The course is organized into weekly meetings consisting of instructor led project-driven topics organized as workshops and studio work sessions. It is expected that all students are active participants in each session. This course will require considerable effort outside of class time. Plan work sessions with others as much as possible and be sure to take care of your mind and body so as not to get too stressed or overexert yourself. If you should need assistance managing stress or otherwise, you can get in touch with CAPS . Deliverables \u00b6 This is an experimental project based course, largely driven by student research and interests. Each week will follow a similar format when it comes to finding balance between theory and practice. It's expected that each student has varying skills and interests upon entering the course and are excited to expand on them and apply them towards their areas of interest. The course deliverables consist of \" Looking Outwards \" Reports to discover the emerging boundaries of XR and report on them, Workouts to develop skills in 3D asset creation, C# scripting, and modern XR toolkits, Assignments to put research findings into practice and exercise creative faculties, and a Final Project to design and build a functional XR experience. Each deliverable is expected to vary based on the area of interest and parameters defined. The following outlines the general criteria for course deliverables throughout the semester. Looking Outwards \u00b6 What is a \"Looking Outwards\" Report? It's simply a blog post containing your research, thoughts, and ideas on a particular topic of interest. This means you should be looking at a variety of information sources such as blogs, emerging tech news, research papers, design/art/tech focused websites, tutorials, etc. covering the topics listed under Course Themes and reporting on what you find each week. These kinds of reports are due almost every week as noted in the schedule and count towards 10% of your final grade. This approach is inspired by Prof. Golan Levin's Looking Outwards Reports for the course Interactivity & Computation at CMU School of Art. Why are we doing these? Reason 1: I literally can\u2019t keep up with the changes taking place in the various fields related to XR and I need your help. Many hands make light work. You are the pioneers of this class and are tasked with discovering content and creating documentation that adds to the field of Immersive Media Design. Reason 2: We need to build a body of documentation that connect several disparate fields. Conducting research across several fields will uncover new and interesting opportunities for us. Throughout the semester I will document our collective findings under Looking Outwards (found in the left sidebar under CM 2 IMD). Workouts \u00b6 What is a \"Workout\"? A workout is some kind of weekly exercise that aims to practice and build skills. It's just what it sounds like, a way to work your \"muscles.\" What form do these take? They can take the form of reading technical documentation, writing code, solving a design challenge, trying out new software, and working through video tutorials that challenge and enable practice of concepts discussed in class. These are not graded but are highly recommended because they will provide greater understanding of a specific topic through focused hands-on practice. You may write blog posts for the workouts you do to help document your progress and process but it's not required. Assignments \u00b6 What is an Assignment? An assignment is a graded mini-project that aims to apply skills towards a goal. What form do these take? They are largely based on the topics explored in class, through the workouts, and through your research. They allow you to dig into and expand on a topic that interests you within the field of Immersive Media Design. They can be thought of as projects to build towards developing your final project or one-off experiments exploring a particular technique or software workflow you are interested in. Assignments are due every few weeks as noted on the schedule and count towards 40% of your final grade. Final Project \u00b6 Read more about writing a project proposal and final project deliverables here . Grading & Evaluation \u00b6 Grades for the course follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown. Type Percentage of Grade Looking Outwards 10 % Workouts Not graded Assignments 40 % Final Project 50 % Work is evaluated based on the following: Done vs Not Done. Done gets credit, Not Done does not get credit. Quality and Quantity of deliverables. This studio based course requires a healthy level of creative immersion and balance to be successful. Explore your creative process through making and always deliver to the best of your abilities. Achieve quality through quantity. Engagement with the subject matter. If something isn't interesting to you, make it interesting. Clarity of documentation. Make it easy for others to read and understand. Collaboration will also be a factor of evaluation if you choose to work on projects in teams of no more than 3-4 people. The division of duties on any project needs to be clearly defined and documented by all team members and will factor into individual evaluations.

Start by investigating some of sites above. Identify 2-3 applications or aspects of VR and/or AR you find intriguing. What's interesting to you about your findings? Try to be specific. Identify 2-3 creatives (story tellers, designers, developers, coders, etc) that are making interesting digital content or VR and/or AR based media or works. What are they making? Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow. What's inspiring about the work? What kinds of tools are they using? Share a link to your post with user group @imd in Slack channel #cmstudio . Due: Jan 27 Workout [0]: Getting Started This week you need to download and install the required software listed in the IMD Setup Guide . You should start exploring any of the tools through the freely available and built in documentation, tutorials, and guides. Adobe, Cinema4D, Unity, and XCode have large user communities and great documentation to get started. My suggestion is to start getting familiar with Unity since much of the work we do will end up in there. I suggest looking in the Unity tutorials for a Foundational tutorial or Creator Kit tutorial that interests you to work through over the next week. Getting Started with Unity learn.unity.com Creator Kit: Puzzle Projects Unity Manual Week 2: No Class \u00b6 Jan 20 MLK Day, No Class Week 3: Intro to Cinema 4D \u00b6 Jan 27 Looking Outwards [0] - What did you find? Workout [0] - Any software issues? What did you make? Course Repo: CM2-IMD - You will be able to find the examples we talk about in class here. This week we are starting to look at C4D's comprehensive set of tools for creating assets that can be used in VR and AR. Many people use the tools for motion graphics, which you will quickly find as you start investigating the tutorials and resources out there. Just like other 3D design software, it can be a bit intimidating at first since there are so many ways to use it and so many tools to get familiar with. In my experience, it's best to start by focusing on understanding a few tools that help you accomplish a specific task, then continue exploring whats possible as you learn your way around. C4D is similar to Blender, Autodesk Maya, and After Effects in many ways and combines the best of some of these tools into something approachable for designers new to working in 3D. Most people working in the motion graphics world utilize some combination of C4D, After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop.

Before we jump further into building VR and AR applications, it's good to have some understanding of at least one 3D design workflow or toolset for producing content. Your objective this week is to investigate what designers are doing and how they are doing it to bring ideas to life. Whether producing content for ads or marketing, designing animated info graphics or data visualization, or exploring digital art or building games, understanding the role of motion design in our digital landscape is an essential part of any modern designers toolkit. Identify 2-3 applications or aspects of motion design or motion graphics you find intriguing. What's interesting to you about your findings? Try to be specific. Identify 2-3 creatives (artists, designers, freelancers, agencies, collectives, etc) that are exploring motion design. What are they making and how? Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow. Share a link to your post with user group @imd in Slack channel #cmstudio . Due: Feb 3 Workout [1]: Getting Familiar with Cinema 4D This week I would like you to explore Cinema 4D as a tool for creating 3D assets for use in VR and AR applications. I assume most are new to the environment so just explore the resources below to get a feel for how to work with the tools. Most importantly, attempt to make something that you are interested in. You can use these tutorials are starting points or explore another workflow you find. Getting Started with Cinema 4D Getting Started with Cinema 4D by EJ Hassenfratz - A great introduction series.

Workout [0] - Any software issues? What did you make? Course Repo: CM2-IMD - You will be able to find the examples we talk about in class here. This week we are starting to look at C4D's comprehensive set of tools for creating assets that can be used in VR and AR. Many people use the tools for motion graphics, which you will quickly find as you start investigating the tutorials and resources out there. Just like other 3D design software, it can be a bit intimidating at first since there are so many ways to use it and so many tools to get familiar with. In my experience, it's best to start by focusing on understanding a few tools that help you accomplish a specific task, then continue exploring whats possible as you learn your way around. C4D is similar to Blender, Autodesk Maya, and After Effects in many ways and combines the best of some of these tools into something approachable for designers new to working in 3D. Most people working in the motion graphics world utilize some combination of C4D, After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop.

Before we jump further into building VR and AR applications, it's good to have some understanding of at least one 3D design workflow or toolset for producing content. Your objective this week is to investigate what designers are doing and how they are doing it to bring ideas to life. Whether producing content for ads or marketing, designing animated info graphics or data visualization, or exploring digital art or building games, understanding the role of motion design in our digital landscape is an essential part of any modern designers toolkit. Identify 2-3 applications or aspects of motion design or motion graphics you find intriguing. What's interesting to you about your findings? Try to be specific. Identify 2-3 creatives (artists, designers, freelancers, agencies, collectives, etc) that are exploring motion design. What are they making and how?

Course Repo \u00b6 You will be able to find the Rhino and Grasshopper examples we talk about in class here. Course Repo: CM3-PPD Workload \u00b6 This is a 3 credit hour course. You should expect to dedicate at least 2-3 hours per credit hour. This translates into a 6-9 hours per week. Consider 6 hours a minimum expectation for one studio course and plan accordingly with your other studio courses. Deliverables for the course consist of \" Looking Outwards \" Reports, Workouts , Assignments , and a Final Project . These are to be submitted weekly as blog posts on the due date specified each week. In general, assignment parameters will be based on the topics of the week and due the following week by the start of class time. Refer to the Deliverables section for more detail. The course is organized into weekly meetings consisting of instructor led project-driven topics organized as workshops and studio work sessions. It is expected that all students are active participants in each session. This course will require considerable effort outside of class time. Plan work sessions with others as much as possible and be sure to take care of your mind and body so as not to get too stressed or overexert yourself. If you should need assistance managing stress or otherwise, you can get in touch with CAPS . Deliverables \u00b6 This is an experimental project based course, largely driven by student research and interests. Each week will follow a similar format when it comes to finding balance between theory and practice. It's expected that each student has varying skills and interests upon entering the course and are excited to expand on them and apply them towards their areas of interest. The course deliverables consist of \" Looking Outwards \" Reports to discover the emerging boundaries of parametric product design and report on them, Workouts to develop skills in 2D/3D design with Rhino and Grasshopper, digital fabrication, and product design, Assignments to put research findings into practice and exercise creative faculties, and a Final Project to develop a product design system and family of physical products. Each deliverable is expected to vary based on the area of interest and parameters defined. The following outlines the general criteria for course deliverables throughout the semester. Looking Outwards \u00b6 What is a \"Looking Outwards\" Report? It's simply a blog post containing your research, thoughts, and ideas on a particular topic of interest. This means you should be looking at a variety of information sources such as blogs, emerging tech news, research papers, design/art/tech focused websites, tutorials, etc. covering the topics listed under Course Themes and reporting on what you find each week. These kinds of reports are due almost every week as noted in the schedule and count towards 10% of your final grade.

Week 1: Overview \u00b6 Jan 17 (Friday) Overview of Course Course Deliverables PPD Setup Guide Parametric Design (Fall 2019) Looking Outwards [0]: The Parametric Design Landscape Begin to investigate the field of parametric design and what designers working parametrically are doing. Much of the work out there falls into the domain of architecture because they are the primary users of parametric design software. But, what if we begin to focus in on products that modern digital fabrication techniques such as laser cutting, 3d printing, and cnc milling can produce? What new forms are possible with both access to powerful design software in combination with the ability to physically make? Identify 2-3 areas ripe for parametric design experimentation. What kinds of products can you imagine benefiting from parametric design? Identify 2-3 creatives (designers, architects, etc) that are making interesting forms, objects, installations, or artifacts. What are they making? Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow. What's inspiring about the work? What kinds of tools are they using?

Looking Outwards [1]: Patterns in Product Design How can patterns be applied to product design? Identify some examples of products that make use of 2D and/or 3D patterns. Analyze the patterns used in attempt to deconstruct them and identify key characteristics. Sometimes you can start a design exploration from a pattern of interest. Is the pattern 2D, 3D, or a combination? Is it made of tesselations or tilings ? Is there a kind of symmetry ? Are the patterns more organic and natural in appearance? How are the patterns produced - by hand, machine, process or combination?

It's simply a blog post containing your research, thoughts, and ideas on a particular topic of interest. This means you should be looking at a variety of information sources such as blogs, emerging tech news, research papers, design/art/tech focused websites, tutorials, etc. covering the topics listed under Course Themes and reporting on what you find each week. These kinds of reports are due almost every week as noted in the schedule and count towards 10% of your final grade. This approach is inspired by Prof. Golan Levin's Looking Outwards Reports for the course Interactivity & Computation at CMU School of Art. Why are we doing these? There are a few reasons: Reason 1: I literally can\u2019t keep up with the changes taking place in the various fields related to parametric design and I need your help. Many hands make light work. You are the pioneers of this class and are tasked with discovering content and creating documentation that adds to the field of Parametric Product Design. Reason 2: We need to build a body of documentation that connect several disparate fields. Conducting research across several fields will uncover new and interesting opportunities for us. Throughout the semester I will document our collective findings under Looking Outwards (found in the left sidebar under CM 3 PPD).","title":"Looking Outwards"},{"location":"APRD-5017/#workouts","text":"What is a \"Workout\"? A workout is some kind of weekly exercise that aims to practice and build skills. What form do these take? They can take the form of reading technical documentation, writing code, solving a design challenge, trying out new software, and working through video tutorials that challenge and enable practice of concepts discussed in class. These are not graded but are highly recommended because they will provide greater understanding of a specific topic through focused hands-on practice.

An assignment is a graded mini-project that aims to apply skills towards a goal. What form do these take? They are largely based on the topics explored in class, through the workouts, and through your research. They allow you to dig into and expand on a topic that interests you within the field of Parametric Product Design. They can be thought of as projects to build towards developing your final project or one-off experiments exploring a particular technique or software workflow you are interested in.

Done gets credit, Not Done does not get credit. Quality and Quantity of deliverables. This studio based course requires a healthy level of creative immersion and balance to be successful. Explore your creative process through making and always deliver to the best of your abilities. Achieve quality through quantity. Engagement with the subject matter. If something isn't interesting to you, make it interesting. Clarity of documentation. Make it easy for others to read and understand. Collaboration will also be a factor of evaluation if you choose to work on projects in teams of no more than 3-4 people.

Much of the work out there falls into the domain of architecture because they are the primary users of parametric design software. But, what if we begin to focus in on products that modern digital fabrication techniques such as laser cutting, 3d printing, and cnc milling can produce? What new forms are possible with both access to powerful design software in combination with the ability to physically make? Identify 2-3 areas ripe for parametric design experimentation. What kinds of products can you imagine benefiting from parametric design? Identify 2-3 creatives (designers, architects, etc) that are making interesting forms, objects, installations, or artifacts. What are they making? Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow. What's inspiring about the work? What kinds of tools are they using?

Due: Jan 27 Workout [0]: Getting Started This week you need to download and install the required software listed in the PPD Setup Guide . You can use Rhino for 90 days with no restrictions. I suggest purchasing a license after the trial period from the CU Bookstore for $90. Start reading through some of the listed resources for learning Rhino and Grasshopper. There are many great tutorials and channels on YouTube that cover different aspects of the environment and ways of working. I think you will quickly find that the quality and content varies quite a bit so it's good to have some foundational skills under your belt before jumping into lots of video tutorials. If you are brand new to Rhino you will want to go through some basic Rhino tutorials to get familiar with the environment.

Looking Outwards [1]: Patterns in Product Design How can patterns be applied to product design? Identify some examples of products that make use of 2D and/or 3D patterns. Analyze the patterns used in attempt to deconstruct them and identify key characteristics. Sometimes you can start a design exploration from a pattern of interest. Is the pattern 2D, 3D, or a combination? Is it made of tesselations or tilings ? Is there a kind of symmetry ? Are the patterns more organic and natural in appearance? How are the patterns produced - by hand, machine, process or combination?

To use: Navigate to your project directory: cd /Users/username/code Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git my-project-name This will clone the cm-sandbox repo into a new project folder named my-project-name . Now you have a starting point for a new web project running with live-server . If you plan to make any commits to a repo on Github with this new project folder you will need to create a repo on Github with the same project name and assign the remote to your repo. Assign a new remote to your new project repo. Assuming I have a new project folder called my-project-name and a new repo on Github with the same name, follow the steps below and replace the remote URL with your new repo URL. 1 2 cd my-project-name git remote -v You will see something like this returned: 1 2 origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (push) Copy the url to your new Github repo and use with the git remote command then push the changes to your repo. Check what the remote is set to by using the git remote command as above. It should be updated with your new project URL. Prior to pushing the changes you can make any edits to the files in the repo and add them and commit them. 1 2 3 git remote set-url origin https://github.com/rjduran/my-project-name.git git remote -v git push -u origin master You can read more about changing remotes between HTTPS and SSH and vice versa here . How to Build a Sandbox \u00b6 This short tutorial is adapted from Assignment 2: Build a Sandbox, Fall 2018 . Create a local development workspace (aka sandbox ) to prototype with HTML, CSS, and JS. By the end of this you should have something that looks like my cm-sandbox repo. What is the purpose of this? To become familiar with the file types, languages, and how they work together. At a fundamental level this approach to experimentation establishes good development practices and efficient workflows. It also supports hands-on learning, which is the only way to improve as a programmer. As a programmer you want to be in control of your code, tools, workflow, and system. ( Don't let the computer control you. ). Tip Pro Tip: Setup a working directory for all programming projects (For Example, /Users/username/code ). This directory then becomes your goto location for anything having to do with code, programming, cloning repos from github, experimenting with new tools and software, and more. This is precisely how I organize my system. Download and install Node.js and live-server . Verify node and npm are installed via Terminal: node -v && npm -v . You should see two version numbers matching what you installed. Install live-server globally: npm install -g live-server If you have done all this correctly you should be able to download a zip of (or clone the) cm-code git repo and run the hello-live-server example via Terminal. Create a Github account and make a repository for your web project (as demonstrated in class). You can name the repo anything you want. For example, \"cm-sandbox\". Clone a copy of this repository to your machine via Terminal. git clone <repo-url> . Setup your machine to make use of a local development folder and local development server (See tip above and Step 1). Create 3 files in your web project repository folder (ie. the project \"folder\" or \"repo\" you created and then cloned from Github in step 3). index.html - ( quick boilerplate template , copy and paste code from here) style.css script.js Launch your local development server ( live-server ) via Terminal and code editor of choice (ex. Atom or VSCode) and make some changes to the files in your web project. Remember the purpose of a local development environment is to \"simulate\" how the code will perform when uploaded to another web server. Open a browser and goto the url shown. It will be http://localhost:8000 or something similar. Create a basic html page using validated markup (Hint: Using a tool like FreeFormatter , check that your code works as expected.) Add some css selectors to your style.css file. Add some basic Javascript functionality to your script.js file. Commit the file changes to your Github repo. You should see the changes in the Github repo summary.

To use: Navigate to your project directory: cd /Users/username/code Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git my-project-name This will clone the cm-sandbox repo into a new project folder named my-project-name . Now you have a starting point for a new web project running with live-server . If you plan to make any commits to a repo on Github with this new project folder you will need to create a repo on Github with the same project name and assign the remote to your repo. Assign a new remote to your new project repo. Assuming I have a new project folder called my-project-name and a new repo on Github with the same name, follow the steps below and replace the remote URL with your new repo URL. 1 2 cd my-project-name git remote -v You will see something like this returned: 1 2 origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (push) Copy the url to your new Github repo and use with the git remote command then push the changes to your repo. Check what the remote is set to by using the git remote command as above. It should be updated with your new project URL. Prior to pushing the changes you can make any edits to the files in the repo and add them and commit them. 1 2 3 git remote set-url origin https://github.com/rjduran/my-project-name.git git remote -v git push -u origin master You can read more about changing remotes between HTTPS and SSH and vice versa here .","title":"Critical Making Sandbox"},{"location":"repos/#how-to-build-a-sandbox","text":"This short tutorial is adapted from Assignment 2: Build a Sandbox, Fall 2018 . Create a local development workspace (aka sandbox ) to prototype with HTML, CSS, and JS. By the end of this you should have something that looks like my cm-sandbox repo. What is the purpose of this? To become familiar with the file types, languages, and how they work together. At a fundamental level this approach to experimentation establishes good development practices and efficient workflows. It also supports hands-on learning, which is the only way to improve as a programmer. As a programmer you want to be in control of your code, tools, workflow, and system. ( Don't let the computer control you. ). Tip Pro Tip: Setup a working directory for all programming projects (For Example, /Users/username/code ).

Node.js apps require a system that allows a Javascript runtime (process) to run all the time using a process management tool like PM2 . This means a \"shared host\" like Bluehost or another service that offers budget shared hosting typically doesn't support running apps like this. Below are some tutorials from hosts that offer these kinds of servers. Another important thing to mention is when you work with hosts like Digital Ocean or Heroku, you typically have to setup and configure the \"server instance\", which means you become the administrator responsible for installing and configuring the operating system (Ubuntu or another form of Linux or Windows) to be a web server. These hosts are providing whats called a \"Virtual Private Server\" aka a VPS with a dedicated IP address which you can think of like a small piece of a much larger server called the \"cloud\".

Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran\u2019s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at: http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html and at http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs Disability \u00b6 If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions: Injuries, Surgeries, and Illnesses guidelines under Quick Links at Disability Services website and discuss your needs with your professor. Religious Observance \u00b6 Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. Please notify me as quickly as possible regarding any possible absences so that we can plan your work accordingly. See full details at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html Discrimination and Harassment \u00b6 The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. The University of Colorado does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational programs and activities. (Regent Law, Article 10, amended 11/8/2001). CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, \"Protected Classes\" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or veteran status. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be obtained at http://hr.colorado.edu/dh/ Honor Code \u00b6 All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and at http://honorcode.colorado.edu Athletic Events \u00b6 The Boulder Campus has two separate but similar policies governing conflicts between a student's athletic events and his or her classes and exams. One policy governs students involved in intercollegiate varsity athletic events. The other policy governs students involved in Club Sports events. Each policy is accompanied by a detailed report with guidance on how instructors may deal with conflicts when they arise. Both policies may be viewed in detail on the Boulder Faculty Assembly's website: Policy on conflicts involving Intercollegiate Athletics, http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/committees/IAC.html Policy on conflicts involving Club Sports http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/committees/studentaffairs.html The two policies are substantially similar, having the following terms in common: That it is the student's responsibility to notify each instructor, in the first week of the semester and in writing, about any known conflicts between academic requirements and athletic events. That instructors have full authority to decide whether and/or how to accommodate those conflicts. While an instructor has the right to refuse to make accommodations, he or she is permitted to provide such accommodations. That coaches are forbidden from initiating contact with instructors regarding schedule conflicts, grades, or academic progress. The Intercollegiate Athletics Office of Academic Support Services and the Recreation Center's Collegiate Club Sports coordinators may contact instructors about certain topics. There is no rule preventing faculty from contacting these support organizations.Policy terms that are specific to intercollegiate varsity events, as opposed to club sports events, include: That intercollegiate varsity athletic events during final exams, which are normally forbidden by university policy, must be approved in writing by the BFA Intercollegiate Athletics Committee well in advance of the event. Students involved in these events must then work with their instructors in regard to any missed work.","title":"CU Policies and Procedures"},{"location":"studio-handbook/policies/#cu-policies-and-procedures","text":"","title":"CU Policies and Procedures"},{"location":"studio-handbook/policies/#classroom-behavior","text":"Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment.
