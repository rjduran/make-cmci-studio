In this course students work towards becoming fluent with digital and physical tools and technologies supporting their creative visions for new products and services. This includes working with modern web technologies (languages, frameworks, API\u2019s) to produce functional prototypes, surveying Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools for 3D modeling and visualization and leveraging digital fabrication tools (3D Printing, Laser Cutting, CNC Milling) to rapidly produce physical objects and prototypes. The course will culminate in a final project leveraging the various digital and physical tools, techniques, skills, and knowledge gained throughout the semester. Project examples include web-based applications, connected experiences, smart devices, everyday / enchanted / functional objects, media-based installations, and product-based experiences.

Some of the resources used across the different courses are divided up into sections found on the left sidebar. Course specific resources will be found within the course schedule page specific to each course, also found on the left sidebar. Do I need to know all of these tools? No! Think of these resources as maps containing many possible tools that could help you accomplish your work and from which you can choose some to learn and work with. There are pros and cons to any tool and all have a set of functionalities and a purpose. As with any tool and any kind of personal creative process you are free to choose anything that works for you. In addition to the tools found here in the digital space, you have access to physical tools for building anything you can imagine here at the studio, on campus at the Idea Forge , or in the community at BLDG61 . IMPORTANT: In this time of COVID-19, be sure to investigate any policies and regulations for all campus based or non-CU based resources before using them. Be safe. Our Studios CMCI Studio facilities include the large main room (West Studio) and adjacent smaller room (North Studio). Both rooms contain different functionalities for developing projects at varying scales and for varying audiences. Read through the Studio Handbook for learning about each room and accessing the various tools and capabilities we have on site. CMCI Equipment Resources CMCI has a large collection of media production equipment for students to use. The Armory Vault and ENVD Checkout reservation systems have many items for general purpose use. With each system there are conditions that must be met. Visit each page to learn more. Learn more about all the on campus resources available at https://www.colorado.edu/facilities/cmci-equipment/ . Armory Vault ENVD Checkout Idea Forge The Idea Forge is an on-campus design and fabrication facility open to all students located in the Fleming Building (near the Wolf Law Building at Broadway & Baseline Rd). In this course we will be making use of the tools and resources available to build projects and develop skills. Learn more at https://www.colorado.edu/ideaforge/ . Fall 2020 Operations CU Boulder Campus Map Hours Workshop Schedule BLDG61: Boulder Library Makerspace BLDG 61 is a free community workshop that provides maker education and technology to the public in a creative and inclusive environment. They are located nearby, just down the street from our studio. They offer a variety of free workshops and access to tools and knowledge within the larger Boulder community. I highly recommend becoming familiar with their space. Learn more at https://boulderlibrary.org/bldg61/ . Course Workload The CM1 is a 3 credit hour course. You should expect to dedicate at least 2-3 hours per credit hour. This translates into a 6-9 hours per week. Consider 6 hours a minimum expectation for one studio course and plan accordingly with your other studio courses. Assignments for the course consist of weekly blog posts demonstrating project-based and process oriented research and explorations in making . Assignment parameters will be based on the topic of the week and \"due\" the following week by the start of class time. Refer to the Course Deliverables section for more information. The course is organized into weekly meetings consisting of instructor led project-driven topics organized as workshops and studio work sessions. It is expected that all students are active participants in each session. Course Deliverables CM1 is a project based course and largely driven by student research and interests. As such, each deliverable is expected to vary based on the project parameters and requirements. The following outlines the general criteria for course deliverables throughout the semester. Assignments Assignments are given weekly and need to be submitted as a blog post published to your Critical Making blog. A minimum of 1 blog post per week is the expectation. Medium is widely used in other studio classes but any blogging platform may be used. Posts are to be submitted via slack #cmstudio by the specified due date each week. It is recommended that a post includes a variety of media and content to support the subject matter. For example: text, images, video, graphics, photos, mockups, screen captures, tutorials, 3d model viewers (sketchfab), sketches, code, gifs, references, etc. Anything that is required to effectively communicate the details of a project, process, prototype, or idea. The subject matter is in response to the topics of the week. Ideally, it falls in line with your interests, research area, project, creative process, etc. For example, you might consider doing a series of tutorials on a topic that interests you or a process/workflow you are currently exploring through the course. Posts should be written to the best of your abilities and for a public audience. The post and any accompanying visual content (images, video) may be shared on social media.

Such a map might be a timeline, visualization, info graphic, mind map, photographic series, video, written document, or any combination of these formats. Include your interests and pursuits in CMCI Studio. Questions: What led you to CMCI Studio? What is your question? Based on the survey, what do you feel strong in and what are you excited to learn more about through this course? Where do you see yourself by the end of the program? If you could design and build anything, what would it be? Resources Mind Mapping Part 2: Things I Like & Dislike Choose 3 things you like (or love) and 3 things you dislike (or hate) and describe what they mean to you and why. Possible choices might be products, objects, artifacts, or experiences. Be wary of pointing out behaviors in people or circumstances beyond your control or judgement. Focus on the tangible attributes that you can clearly articulate. Questions: What\u2019s their story? Who made them and why? Why do or did they exist? Why do you find them intriguing or despise them? Deliverable: Write and submit a blog post for Part 1 and Part 2 on your blog. Include any media in your post that supports your thoughts and ideas. Share a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio by Sept 7 (Labor Day). Due: Sept 7 Week 2: Tools for Development Aug 31 | Location: Zoom Meeting Today in class we will be working on setting up software and becoming familiar with some of the tools used for development. Questions Assignment #2 begins today Class Format over Zoom Break out rooms? Setting up your development environment What's that and why do we need it? What does a development environment look like? IDE's vs Text Editors, working code folder, Terminal, Node.js, NPM, Version Control. The combination of all these tools is what I refer to as a \"sandbox\" or local development environment. Terminal Workshop Hello Terminal Basic folder navigation and file creation Moving From Bash to Zsh: Terminal Changes in macOS Catalina Showing hidden files on your system \"dot\" files (aka a file with a dot or period at the beginning of it's filename is a hidden file) Install Git Github Workshop Version Control (aka a time machine for code/data) Setup Github account Create your first repo Markdown Demo: Local development environment Reference: Make a Sandbox (aka local dev server environment) Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software ASCII vs Binary Files ASCII - Data for a human to read/write Binary - Data for a computer to read/write Development Environment Lets get started by setting up a development environment. The most basic things you need for any web development tasks are a text editor and a browser like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Other tools such as the Terminal, Git, Github, and Node.js enable you to work with all sorts of libraries and frameworks, collaborate with others, and quickly prototype new ideas. All these tools come together under the idea of running a \"local development server\" or localhost on your machine. We will be setting up all these parts and will utilize them in different ways over the course of the semester. If you are curious about the history of electronics, computers, computer science, programming, and the Internet, check out the Histories section. I strongly advise you to start getting familiar with the various histories and technological underpinnings of the technologies you use every day. Remember, it's also about building awareness and understanding about the systems that run our world. These resources are meant to work through at your own speed and as you begin to ask deeper questions about why something works and how something works. I also highly recommend the book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold. It is a foundational text on why computers are the way they are and how they work, beginning with code. Text Editors What is a text editor? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? When it comes to web development or software development work, you need a text editor capable of working with ASCII data and rich in features supporting development tasks. My editor of choice is currently Visual Studio Code (VSCode) . Will Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages work? No! These are word processing applications that deal primarily with binary data because in addition to the actual text information stored in a .doc file, it encapsulates data such as font and formatting. Don't use these editors for this kind of work. You will be sad. Terminal Workshop What is the Terminal? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? Goals: Get familiar with the terminal by creating and manipulating files and folders on your system. Set up git to be able to use version control to manage projects on Github. Terminal 101 Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app For the Windows users: Cmder is a Terminal emulator that works in a similar way to the mac terminal. How to display hidden files on MacOS Customize your Terminal in Terminal > Preferences. It helps to make the text larger on most screens. Common commands: cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm, mv, cp, pwd, man, touch . Think of all these commands as tiny applications that have no GUI. They are very old and have been around since the start of Unix based systems (Read this to learn more: Looking back at OS X's origins ). Look at MacOS/Linux/Unix Command Line Cheat Sheet to see more information about common commands. Working with directories and files: cd <folder> - Goto into a folder cd .. - Go up one level cd ../<folder> - Go up one level (to parent folder) and into a child folder cd ../.. - Go up two levels etc Tab completion - When you start typing in a terminal you can hit tab to complete the command if the file or folder you are going to use is available. If you hit Tab twice, you will see the contents of a folder. Getting out of or killing a process that is running in Terminal: ctrl + c Install Git You will likely not have Git installed on your machine by default. You will know if you have it or not when you type git into the Terminal. If you do have it installed you will see information about how to use it. If you don't, you will see the output \"command not found\". You may be prompted to install XCode Developer Tools when installing git. Accept the install and proceed. You have two options to install git: Install the XCode Developer tools (easy way) or download the installer from git-scm . After installing it the git command should work in the Terminal. This is essential to working with Github. Resources Learning Terminal - Cheetsheets and more! Learning Git How to use Terminal on Mac , How to use a Terminal on Windows Command Line Cheat Sheet by git-tower - This one is great for both git and terminal commands! Github Workshop Goals: Setup a Github account Create your first repository Publish some code to it How to Use Github Sign up for a Github account . Choose a username wisely. You might just be \"Internet famous\" someday. ( Stuck on choosing a username? Read this. A Tale of Github Usernames ) Create a hello-world repo on Github . If you check the box to add a README file it will include a README.md file in the repo. This is the main information file shown when you goto the repo URL Markdown = text file with special syntax that gets converted into HTML. Review Markdown Cheatsheet . Complete list of github markdown emoji markup Clone your repo using the terminal. Doing this will download a copy of your repository onto your machine. Clone Repo: git clone <repo url> . For Example, git clone git@github.com:rjduran/cm-sandbox.git . Note the URL and its use of \"git\" or \"https\". Use \"https\" to start. You need to go through the Github tutorial below in step #4 to connect to Github via SSH. Open VSCode and add the cloned folder to the workspace Make some changes to your README.md file using VSCode Stage the changes: git add . or git add README.md Commit the changes: git commit -m \"my message describing changes\" Push the changes: git push You will be asked for your username and password when attempting to push changes to your repo at this stage. Once the changes are uploaded you will see the changes on the Github page for the repo. Yay! Good times! Success! Pro tip: After setting up your Github account, read through Connecting to Github with SSH to setup your system to connect securely to Github and not require you to enter your username and password credentials each time you push changes. Assignment 2: Everyday Project Objective: Make something and capture a digital representation of it each day for the next 2 weeks. You should have at a minimum 14 objects. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Choose any tool(s) at your disposal. Choose any theme or topic. Date Range: Monday Aug 31 to Monday Sept 14 Decide how you will document your project. For example, Instagram, blog post, a single image, a document, a Github repo commit, a video, etc. Consider how the result will travel digitally. Refer to the projects and practices you observed from last week. Questions: What do you already make and want to make more of? What new thing has peaked your interest and will you use to make something every day? Deliverable: Submit a blog post documenting your project process and outcome in Slack #cmstudio . Due: Sept 14 Week 3: Labor Day Sept 7 Labor Day, No Class Phase 2: The Modern Web In this phase we will talk about web development paradigms and practices and you will build your web development skills inside and outside of class. We will approach each topic with simplicity in mind and focus on understanding fundamental concepts. To build advanced skills with the tools we discuss you will need to dedicate time outside of class for further experimentation. We will approach topics in a hands-on workshop format so be prepared to dive in. If you do have some web development experience coming into the program think about some new aspects of development you are curious about such as libraries, frameworks, responsiveness, interactivity, animations, Javascript, types of tech stacks, or just how you can improve your skills in what you know through practice. The goal of this phase is to gain a sense of how you can utilize web technologies to solve problems. Week 4: Intro to Web Development Sept 14 | Location: Zoom Meeting Discussion CMCI Equipment Resources Assignments 1,2 Share Terminal, Git/Github Questions Github: How do I make a copy of a repo into another folder? Github: How do I assign a different remote to a repo? Repo for this phase: https://github.com/rjduran/cm1-web-dev The World Wide Web What is the World Wide Web and what is its purpose? The purpose of building websites and web applications is to make an idea accessible to people. While we won't look into the history of the Internet very much, it's still worth spending some time reading more about the innovations and contributions to the Internet as we know it today under the History of the Internet section. The Industry What do web developers do? Collaborate, write code, evaluate new tools, solve technical problems, synthesize, make prototypes. What do web developers need to know? At a minimum the 3 web languages, HTML, CSS, and JS. Beyond this it really depends on the project or idea. Many choose to specialize in different kinds of tech stacks supporting front-end development, back-end development, or full-stack development. Learning how to learn and apply technical skills is your best asset. How do you learn web development skills? Make lots of web things to practice. Make lots of mistakes to learn. Pick up books on the subject. Watch tutorial videos on development topics. Read blogs like those below and try everything you read about. In this ever evolving field you are constantly learning new tools and workflows. Stacks & Maps These resources are for you to investigate the world of development. Think of them as maps to learning about different roles and technologies. Front End, Back End, Full Stack\u2014What Does it All Mean? Front-End vs Back-End vs Full-Stack on Udacity A Guide to Becoming a Full-Stack Developer in 2017 - If you only read one of these, read this one. How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016 - Read through this and see if you can begin to make sense of the current development ecosystem. (Note: Its complex and a little bit insane but this guy makes a good (fun) read of it.) The 2019 Roadmap To Fullstack Web Development The 2019 Web Developer Roadmap - Has some great flowcharts showing how different technologies relate / Github Source . - Look at these maps if you want to see the big picture. Web Languages Workshop | In Class, 45 mins Webpages are constructed in 3 languages - HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Modern browsers will render pages built in these languages more or less the same depending on the viewport size and device orientation. In the resources below you can find some learning pathways for building skills with these tools. Make time to read through the basics of all the languages and try things out. Most importantly, seek to apply the skills you are learning towards projects. How does a web language relate to what a user sees? HTML = Document Structure CSS = Visual Language (Layout, Identity) JS = Interactivity & Dynamics What IS the composition of a webpage? At a basic level all you need is a single index.html file with <html>...</html> and enclosing <body>...</body> tag to render a webpage. All the CSS and JS you may have can exist inside the same file embedded within <style>...</style> and <script>...</script> elements. It only becomes important to separate the 3 types of code when a project becomes too large to manage within a single file, which is very common. Best practices, modularity, and the need for regular maintenance have led developers and designers towards a current approach of establishing and using style guides or coding standards . Exercise 1: Hello HTML Goals: Understand how to make a basic HTML document using a text editor (VS Code) Understand how to structure a document for HTML, CSS, and JS Understand how to use the browser for viewing a page Instructions: Make a new folder called \"hello-world\" for your project files. Pro Tip: Setup a dedicated code folder for all your code based projects. I use one called code inside my home directory (/Users/rjduran or ~/). Open VS Code and add the \"hello-world\" folder to your workspace. Using VS Code make a new file called index.html in your project folder. Open Chrome and open the index.html file. You should see a blank page. This is your document without any content. In your index.html file, add the html, head, and body tags into the document. What are these tags used for? In your index.html file, add a few elements such as h1, h2, p, a, and img into the document body. What are these tags used for? Toggle between Chrome and VS Code to see your changes rendered in the browser. CMD + R to reload the page in Chrome. Exercise 2: Hello CSS Goals: Understand how to add CSS to a HTML document (internal & external) Understand how to use CSS selectors - element, .class, #id Get familiar with how to use CSS properties Instructions: Create a new file called style.css in your \"hello-world\" folder. We will use this in step 8. Create a <style>...</style> tag to insert css into. Which part of your document does this go into? Write your first selector to change the color of a h1 element from black to red. Notice that css allows plain english words used for color or hex values such as #FF0000. (What, hex values? How to Read Hex Color Codes ) Reload the browser to see your changes. Now write a class selector called .title and apply it to the h2 elements. Give the color property a value of green or #00FF00 . What happens when you reload the document? Now write an id selector called #space-cat and apply it to your img element. Lets give the cat pucture a solid border with a 5 pixel width and make it blue. Open your style.css file you created in step 1. We will be copying our css into that file now. Copy and paste the code contained within your <style>...</style> element into style.css file. In your index.html file, insert the link tag to specify the external css file. <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"> . This tells the index file to use the css it finds there. What happens if you load a css file and have css in your index file? Which selectors are used? Reload in the browser to see changes. Resources W3 Schools HTML Reference W3 Schools CSS Reference BREAK - Take 10 min Website Analysis Workshop | Breakout Rooms, 20 mins Goals: Get familiar with the Elements tab in Chrome development tools Understand the general structure of a HTML document Understand how HTML and CSS create visual heirarchy and organization Instructions: Choose one of the Bootstrap examples to inspect. Using the Chrome development tools, inspect the site. Look at the HTML elements and the overall structure of the page. Chrome Developer Tools (Inspector for debugging). Access via: View > Developer > Developer Tools within Chrome. What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Make a quick wireframe sketch on paper of the page you are inspecting. Label the different parts of the page using common terminology (ie. header, sidebar, footer, post, etc) and HTML tags with opening and closing characters( < , > ). What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Identify 2-3 HTML tags and look up their meaning on W3 Schools HTML Element Reference . Share your findings with the group. Exit breakout room and discuss your findings. Local Development Workshop | In Class, 30 mins Goals: Setup a local development server aka Sandbox. We will follow the instructions under How to build a Sandbox . Get familiar with starting / stopping a local server in the terminal Understand the development workflow Instructions: Once your live-server is setup, launch an instance and open the browser. Make an edit to your index.html file and view the changes in the browser. Try launching a second server from another terminal window. What happens? Resources Example: hello-live-server Assignment 3: Ode to Things Choose one (or more) every day object(s) in your life and make a simple website for it / them. You might consider the site as a container for a favored item or collection of things, a product to sell, or simply a site that pays tribute to the item or object and what it means to you in life. This idea was inspired by the website Ode to Things , which is an e-commerce store and curated collection of physical every day products. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Build a webpage from scratch that makes use of HTML elements and CSS selectors. Use necessary html elements that act as containers for different types of content and page heirarchy: text, images, video, etc. Develop your webpage using a local development environment aka live-server. When done, make a repository on Github for your project and commit the required index.html file and and any media files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result without changing filenames or folders. Hint: The repo should look similar to the hello-world folder and files you created in class. It should also include a README.md file since you always include this text file with any Github repo you create. Video: CM1 Assignment 3 Tip: Github, VSCode & Terminal Workflow Advanced Option: If you are feeling comfortable with HTML and CSS, explore an aspect of HTML or CSS that is new to you or take the leap into Javascript or using a front-end framework. Deliverable: A short 1-2 min video screen capture demonstrating your website running in a local development environment as setup in class. Be sure to briefly introduce yourself and your project, provide an overview of what you made and how it works. Embed the video into your blog post. Pro Tip: If you are new to screen capture tools, look into using Screencast-o-matic or the built in screen capture tools of MacOS (CMD + Shift + 5) to document your workflow. Create an account with Youtube and upload your video. Include a link to your Github repo for the code written. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about web development and the tools used? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio by EOD. Due: Sept 21 Week 5: Web Applications & Frameworks Sept 21 | Location: Zoom Meeting Discussion | 20 mins Assignments 3 Share / Questions Project Management Tips Use a .gitignore file or (better way) create a global .gitignore file that ignores .DS_Store. This is a junk file on macOS that creeps into Github projects all the time. Rename files to something short and simple when possible. Replace spaces in filenames with \"-\" or \"_\" characters. When sharing the Github repo you only need to share the URL from the browser. Omit the .git extension. For example, https://github.com/rjduran/cm1-web-dev . File paths - Be sure to only reference files in folders within your project folder. For example, do this /img/image1.jpg and not this /Users/rjduran/Desktop/image.jpg . Relative vs Absolute file paths ( HTML File Paths ) Agenda Javascript Workshop Frameworks & Libraries Break Front-End Workshop Web Applications Javascript Workshop | In Class, 20 mins Javascript is an enormous topic and we will only begin to scratch the surface of it today. I highly recommend working through some of the resources below and looking at the resources under the Learning JS section. There are several great books and tutorial series that can give you a foundational understanding of the language and it's many uses. If you were to learn one programming language, I would recommend this one. Goals: Understand how to add JS to a HTML document (internal & external) Get familiar with how JS can modify the contents of a page Get familiar the Chrome Dev Tools console Instructions: Create a new file called script.js in your \"hello-world\" folder. We will come back to this at a later step. Add the <script>...</script> tag in your document. Where should you place it? Discuss. Inside <head> = load before body contents Just before </body> tag = load after body contents Call the alert function and give it a string of text. What happens when you reload the page? alert(\"hello spacecat!\"); Decalare a variable and give it the same string of text as a value. Now use the variable in the alert. What happens? var message = \"hello spacecat!\"; alert(message); Comment out the alert with a single line comment. Now, print the value to the console in the browser using the console.log() function. What happens? Copy and paste contents of <script> tag into the script.js file and comment out everything inside of <script> . What happens? Resources JS for Cats - This one walks you through the basics of JS using the Developer Tools Console in Chrome. I recommend this one first. JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Javascript in 5 Days - This goes a bit deeper but worth the time spend to understand the basics. I recommend this second. freeCodeCamp - Introduction to Javascript - This tutorial series walks through many common examples and use cases. I recommend it third. W3 Schools JS Tutorial - I recommend this resource as a reference and for the tutorial series. A Study Plan To Cure JavaScript Fatigue (2016) Programming Terminology - A Wikipedia for Programming, Computer Science, and Much More. Don't know a term? Look here. Eloquent Javascript - This is a great free book to learn more about JS language fundamentals. DOM (Document Object Model) The DOM is a standard object model and programming interface created by the browser when a webpage is loaded. It is essentially your HTML page but in a different format now accessible through a browser based programming interface and language (Javascript). In general, JS can manipulate (get, change, add, delete) any part of the DOM (ie. any part of a page or document). Here's a great image of the DOM DOM Tree Visualization Example on CodePen Try opening the Chrome Developer Console and typing document or window . What does it return? How does it relate to the DOM image above? JavaScript DOM Tutorial Series (Video Playlist) - A great series of videos introducing the DOM and how to manipulate it with Javascript. It totals 2 hrs in duration but is extremely helpful to understand some aspects of the Javascript language and how it can be used. Eloquent Javascript: CH 14 - The Document Object Model JS Events and the DOM Frameworks & Libraries What is a framework? What is a Library? Library A library is a collection of code containing objects, functions, and methods that you can use in an application or project. It can be written in CSS, Javascript, or some combination of both. Some common libraries: Google Fonts , Animate.css , Draggable.js , masonry.js , p5.js , D3.js , and Three.js . Framework A framework can be everything you use in application development. It can consist of both front-end and back-end toolsets. It can be a library, a collection of libraries, a collection of scripts, or any piece software you need to create an application. It's best to think about a framework as something that is mostly ready to use out of the box, but still requires an understanding of the terminal, version control, and the web languages: HTML, CSS, and JS. Some common frameworks: Bootstrap , W3.CSS , Materialize , Shoelace , React , Express , and Electron Framework . Evaluating a Library or Framework There are several questions you might ask yourself when choosing to use an existing library or framework. You typically start by looking at the documentation to compare similar features and components and to see if it does something you would like to incorporate into a project. What does it do? What's the benefit of using it? How do you use it? Pros and cons? Are there examples to follow? Is there a large community? Where can I get help?

Top Bootstrap Alternatives Bootstrap Alternatives: The top 36 options in 2020 BREAK - Take 10 min Front-End Workshop | In Class, 45 mins In this workshop we will walk through building a filterable student list from scratch. It will use Bootstrap as the front-end framework and vanilla javascript to filter. References: Figma Design , Github Repo Goals: Learn how to incorporate a front-end library or framework into a project. Understand how to structure a document based on the framework used. Learn how to utilize Javascript to filter a list of items. In this case student names. Instructions: Create a new project folder called \"student-list\". Create an index.html file inside the folder. This will be your primary document. Open Terminal and start a live-server instance inside your project folder. Naviagate to the Bootstrap documentation and look for the Starter Template code. Copy and paste it into your index.html file. You should see an empty page that says Hello, World! in your browser automatically as long as live-server is running. Add a div element with the class=\"container\" inside your body element. All your content will go in here. Below the container div and just ablve the closing body tag, add a <script>... </script> element. This is where we will put all our Javascript code. Refer to the Figma Design to see what the page should look like. What elements will you need to make your document reflect the design in Figma? Tip: Look at the components section of the Bootstrap documentation. Once you have the general structure of the page, we can proceed to make it interactive when typing into the search field by using javascript. Proceed to implement a filter algorithm as described in class. Questions / Next Steps How do I add more data to the page? How do I update the data? Where is the data stored and how do I access it?

The modern term \"web application\" applies to a variety of systems or stacks. Typically, these systems communicate with one or more servers for access to system resources like memory, databases, and cpu or gpu. ie. speed, power, and connectivity. It may have more than one type of client interface. ie. Mobile, desktop, API, or another application. What are some common types of websites or web applications? Static Website - Basic websites, blogs, etc Native or Mobile App Progressive Web App (PWA) - A responsive mobile website that mimics the behavior of native or mobile apps.

Assignment 4: Digital Legos Choose one or more libraries or frameworks and make something with it. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: If you have project in mind for your final project or another project, begin to identify what tools you might use to build that project and attempt to work on a piece of it. What functionalites does the project need? (Maybe there's a library for it) How do you see the project working from the user experience? What design elements can you identify and how might they be coded? Investigate libraries that seem interesting to you. Assess their capabilities and how you can apply it to a project. Begin by looking over examples found in the documentation. Look for \"getting started\" documentation about a library or framework. Work through it and see where it takes you. Google is your best friend. Try to be as specific as possible when invesitgating a library or framework. What is your motivation for learning it and what do you want to accomplish with it? Identify some specific uses of it and focus. Start simple. Dont try to understand it all. If you copy and paste code from somewhere, copy one line at a time and learn what it does. Then add more code and repeat. It's easier to start simply and build up complex functionlaity than to work the other way. Use comments (in JS, HTML, or CSS) to write notes to yourself. Work together! Share code, ideas, and libraries you find with eachother. Have fun with it! Make a repository on Github for your project and commit all project files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result without changing filenames or folders. Note: Your repo should always include a README.md file with instructions about it's use and what it does. Deliverable: A short 2-4 min video screen capture demonstrating your project running in a local development environment. Be sure to briefly introduce yourself and your project, provide an overview of what you made and how it works. Embed the video into your blog post. Include a link to your Github repo for the code written. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about web development and the tools used?

Spend some time researching the APIs of interest and brainstorming how they could be used to solve a problem or simply have some fun and answer a question. Some things to think about when brainstorming and researching APIs: At a high level: What kind of possibilities emerge when researching your chosen APIs together? Whats unique to each API? What features does it have? How do the APIs chosen complement eachother? At a lower level: What kind of data is available? What kind of access is required to make the API work? What does your product or website need to ask of a user? What kind of permission? And what does that mean for how the API is used? When time is up we will take a short 10 min break and come back together and discuss. BREAK - Take 10 min Data What is Data? How is it represented? JSON, CSV, TXT How do I make a database?

JSON JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) - A syntax for storing and exchanging data. JSON Syntax Assignment 5: Connect The Dots This week I would like you to explore the world of APIs in two ways: Design a mashup concept that attempts to solve a problem. Choose an API to get familiar with and attempt to make something using it. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Continue down the path you came up with during class or develop a new approach. Spend some time researching APIs that are in line with products or services you are familiar with and use often. Research mashups that use an API you are exploring. What was done? Can it be improved? What are some of your hobbies and interests? Is there an API for it? If not, what if there was? Whats possible then? Write down the names of a bunch of APIs you research and put them into a hat. Stir it around and pull out two. Repeat this process for a time and write down all the combinations. What's interesting? Look for recent tutorials that make use of an API you are curious about. Attempt to recreate the workflow. Start with simple GET requests and increase the complexity of your queries as you get more familiar with the documentation and API. Work through the class examples and develop a workflow that enables you to work with data in a new way. For example, using Google Forms (for user data input) to generate a database (Google Sheet), which you then can pull data from via API. Experiment with an API and ask \"what if?\" questions in the process. WORK TOGETHER! Make time to work together outside of class. Have fun with it! Make a repository on Github for your project and commit all project files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result without changing filenames or folders. Note: Your repo should always include a README.md file with instructions about it's use and what it does. Deliverable: A blog post describing your ideas and sharing any visuals created or referenced to illustrate the concept. You can record a short video presentation with slides if that helps to share the concept. Embed your video into your blog post. Include a link to your Github repo for any code written.

Questions Assignment #2 begins today Class Format over Zoom Break out rooms? Setting up your development environment What's that and why do we need it? What does a development environment look like? IDE's vs Text Editors, working code folder, Terminal, Node.js, NPM, Version Control. The combination of all these tools is what I refer to as a \"sandbox\" or local development environment. Terminal Workshop Hello Terminal Basic folder navigation and file creation Moving From Bash to Zsh: Terminal Changes in macOS Catalina Showing hidden files on your system \"dot\" files (aka a file with a dot or period at the beginning of it's filename is a hidden file) Install Git Github Workshop Version Control (aka a time machine for code/data) Setup Github account Create your first repo Markdown Demo: Local development environment Reference: Make a Sandbox (aka local dev server environment) Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software ASCII vs Binary Files ASCII - Data for a human to read/write Binary - Data for a computer to read/write Development Environment Lets get started by setting up a development environment. The most basic things you need for any web development tasks are a text editor and a browser like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Other tools such as the Terminal, Git, Github, and Node.js enable you to work with all sorts of libraries and frameworks, collaborate with others, and quickly prototype new ideas. All these tools come together under the idea of running a \"local development server\" or localhost on your machine. We will be setting up all these parts and will utilize them in different ways over the course of the semester. If you are curious about the history of electronics, computers, computer science, programming, and the Internet, check out the Histories section. I strongly advise you to start getting familiar with the various histories and technological underpinnings of the technologies you use every day. Remember, it's also about building awareness and understanding about the systems that run our world. These resources are meant to work through at your own speed and as you begin to ask deeper questions about why something works and how something works. I also highly recommend the book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold. It is a foundational text on why computers are the way they are and how they work, beginning with code. Text Editors What is a text editor? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? When it comes to web development or software development work, you need a text editor capable of working with ASCII data and rich in features supporting development tasks. My editor of choice is currently Visual Studio Code (VSCode) . Will Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages work? No! These are word processing applications that deal primarily with binary data because in addition to the actual text information stored in a .doc file, it encapsulates data such as font and formatting. Don't use these editors for this kind of work. You will be sad. Terminal Workshop What is the Terminal? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? Goals: Get familiar with the terminal by creating and manipulating files and folders on your system. Set up git to be able to use version control to manage projects on Github. Terminal 101 Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app For the Windows users: Cmder is a Terminal emulator that works in a similar way to the mac terminal. How to display hidden files on MacOS Customize your Terminal in Terminal > Preferences. It helps to make the text larger on most screens. Common commands: cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm, mv, cp, pwd, man, touch . Think of all these commands as tiny applications that have no GUI. They are very old and have been around since the start of Unix based systems (Read this to learn more: Looking back at OS X's origins ). Look at MacOS/Linux/Unix Command Line Cheat Sheet to see more information about common commands. Working with directories and files: cd <folder> - Goto into a folder cd .. - Go up one level cd ../<folder> - Go up one level (to parent folder) and into a child folder cd ../.. - Go up two levels etc Tab completion - When you start typing in a terminal you can hit tab to complete the command if the file or folder you are going to use is available. If you hit Tab twice, you will see the contents of a folder. Getting out of or killing a process that is running in Terminal: ctrl + c Install Git You will likely not have Git installed on your machine by default. You will know if you have it or not when you type git into the Terminal. If you do have it installed you will see information about how to use it. If you don't, you will see the output \"command not found\". You may be prompted to install XCode Developer Tools when installing git. Accept the install and proceed. You have two options to install git: Install the XCode Developer tools (easy way) or download the installer from git-scm . After installing it the git command should work in the Terminal. This is essential to working with Github. Resources Learning Terminal - Cheetsheets and more!

The purpose of building websites and web applications is to make an idea accessible to people. While we won't look into the history of the Internet very much, it's still worth spending some time reading more about the innovations and contributions to the Internet as we know it today under the History of the Internet section. The Industry What do web developers do? Collaborate, write code, evaluate new tools, solve technical problems, synthesize, make prototypes. What do web developers need to know? At a minimum the 3 web languages, HTML, CSS, and JS. Beyond this it really depends on the project or idea. Many choose to specialize in different kinds of tech stacks supporting front-end development, back-end development, or full-stack development. Learning how to learn and apply technical skills is your best asset. How do you learn web development skills? Make lots of web things to practice. Make lots of mistakes to learn. Pick up books on the subject. Watch tutorial videos on development topics. Read blogs like those below and try everything you read about. In this ever evolving field you are constantly learning new tools and workflows. Stacks & Maps These resources are for you to investigate the world of development. Think of them as maps to learning about different roles and technologies. Front End, Back End, Full Stack\u2014What Does it All Mean?

Web Languages Workshop | In Class, 45 mins Webpages are constructed in 3 languages - HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Modern browsers will render pages built in these languages more or less the same depending on the viewport size and device orientation. In the resources below you can find some learning pathways for building skills with these tools. Make time to read through the basics of all the languages and try things out. Most importantly, seek to apply the skills you are learning towards projects. How does a web language relate to what a user sees? HTML = Document Structure CSS = Visual Language (Layout, Identity) JS = Interactivity & Dynamics What IS the composition of a webpage? At a basic level all you need is a single index.html file with <html>...</html> and enclosing <body>...</body> tag to render a webpage. All the CSS and JS you may have can exist inside the same file embedded within <style>...</style> and <script>...</script> elements. It only becomes important to separate the 3 types of code when a project becomes too large to manage within a single file, which is very common. Best practices, modularity, and the need for regular maintenance have led developers and designers towards a current approach of establishing and using style guides or coding standards . Exercise 1: Hello HTML Goals: Understand how to make a basic HTML document using a text editor (VS Code) Understand how to structure a document for HTML, CSS, and JS Understand how to use the browser for viewing a page Instructions: Make a new folder called \"hello-world\" for your project files. Pro Tip: Setup a dedicated code folder for all your code based projects. I use one called code inside my home directory (/Users/rjduran or ~/). Open VS Code and add the \"hello-world\" folder to your workspace. Using VS Code make a new file called index.html in your project folder. Open Chrome and open the index.html file. You should see a blank page. This is your document without any content. In your index.html file, add the html, head, and body tags into the document. What are these tags used for? In your index.html file, add a few elements such as h1, h2, p, a, and img into the document body. What are these tags used for? Toggle between Chrome and VS Code to see your changes rendered in the browser. CMD + R to reload the page in Chrome. Exercise 2: Hello CSS Goals: Understand how to add CSS to a HTML document (internal & external) Understand how to use CSS selectors - element, .class, #id Get familiar with how to use CSS properties Instructions: Create a new file called style.css in your \"hello-world\" folder. We will use this in step 8. Create a <style>...</style> tag to insert css into. Which part of your document does this go into? Write your first selector to change the color of a h1 element from black to red. Notice that css allows plain english words used for color or hex values such as #FF0000. (What, hex values? How to Read Hex Color Codes ) Reload the browser to see your changes. Now write a class selector called .title and apply it to the h2 elements. Give the color property a value of green or #00FF00 . What happens when you reload the document? Now write an id selector called #space-cat and apply it to your img element. Lets give the cat pucture a solid border with a 5 pixel width and make it blue. Open your style.css file you created in step 1. We will be copying our css into that file now. Copy and paste the code contained within your <style>...</style> element into style.css file. In your index.html file, insert the link tag to specify the external css file. <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"> . This tells the index file to use the css it finds there. What happens if you load a css file and have css in your index file? Which selectors are used? Reload in the browser to see changes. Resources W3 Schools HTML Reference W3 Schools CSS Reference BREAK - Take 10 min Website Analysis Workshop | Breakout Rooms, 20 mins Goals: Get familiar with the Elements tab in Chrome development tools Understand the general structure of a HTML document Understand how HTML and CSS create visual heirarchy and organization Instructions: Choose one of the Bootstrap examples to inspect. Using the Chrome development tools, inspect the site. Look at the HTML elements and the overall structure of the page. Chrome Developer Tools (Inspector for debugging). Access via: View > Developer > Developer Tools within Chrome. What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Make a quick wireframe sketch on paper of the page you are inspecting. Label the different parts of the page using common terminology (ie. header, sidebar, footer, post, etc) and HTML tags with opening and closing characters( < , > ). What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Identify 2-3 HTML tags and look up their meaning on W3 Schools HTML Element Reference . Share your findings with the group. Exit breakout room and discuss your findings. Local Development Workshop | In Class, 30 mins Goals: Setup a local development server aka Sandbox. We will follow the instructions under How to build a Sandbox . Get familiar with starting / stopping a local server in the terminal Understand the development workflow Instructions: Once your live-server is setup, launch an instance and open the browser. Make an edit to your index.html file and view the changes in the browser. Try launching a second server from another terminal window. What happens? Resources Example: hello-live-server","title":"Week 4: Intro to Web Development"},{"location":"APRD-5005/#assignment-3-ode-to-things","text":"Choose one (or more) every day object(s) in your life and make a simple website for it / them. You might consider the site as a container for a favored item or collection of things, a product to sell, or simply a site that pays tribute to the item or object and what it means to you in life. This idea was inspired by the website Ode to Things , which is an e-commerce store and curated collection of physical every day products. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Build a webpage from scratch that makes use of HTML elements and CSS selectors. Use necessary html elements that act as containers for different types of content and page heirarchy: text, images, video, etc. Develop your webpage using a local development environment aka live-server. When done, make a repository on Github for your project and commit the required index.html file and and any media files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result without changing filenames or folders. Hint: The repo should look similar to the hello-world folder and files you created in class. It should also include a README.md file since you always include this text file with any Github repo you create.

Relative vs Absolute file paths ( HTML File Paths ) Agenda Javascript Workshop Frameworks & Libraries Break Front-End Workshop Web Applications Javascript Workshop | In Class, 20 mins Javascript is an enormous topic and we will only begin to scratch the surface of it today. I highly recommend working through some of the resources below and looking at the resources under the Learning JS section. There are several great books and tutorial series that can give you a foundational understanding of the language and it's many uses. If you were to learn one programming language, I would recommend this one. Goals: Understand how to add JS to a HTML document (internal & external) Get familiar with how JS can modify the contents of a page Get familiar the Chrome Dev Tools console Instructions: Create a new file called script.js in your \"hello-world\" folder. We will come back to this at a later step. Add the <script>...</script> tag in your document. Where should you place it? Discuss. Inside <head> = load before body contents Just before </body> tag = load after body contents Call the alert function and give it a string of text. What happens when you reload the page? alert(\"hello spacecat!\"); Decalare a variable and give it the same string of text as a value. Now use the variable in the alert. What happens? var message = \"hello spacecat!\"; alert(message); Comment out the alert with a single line comment. Now, print the value to the console in the browser using the console.log() function. What happens? Copy and paste contents of <script> tag into the script.js file and comment out everything inside of <script> . What happens? Resources JS for Cats - This one walks you through the basics of JS using the Developer Tools Console in Chrome. I recommend this one first.

Eloquent Javascript - This is a great free book to learn more about JS language fundamentals. DOM (Document Object Model) The DOM is a standard object model and programming interface created by the browser when a webpage is loaded. It is essentially your HTML page but in a different format now accessible through a browser based programming interface and language (Javascript). In general, JS can manipulate (get, change, add, delete) any part of the DOM (ie. any part of a page or document).

It totals 2 hrs in duration but is extremely helpful to understand some aspects of the Javascript language and how it can be used. Eloquent Javascript: CH 14 - The Document Object Model JS Events and the DOM Frameworks & Libraries What is a framework? What is a Library? Library A library is a collection of code containing objects, functions, and methods that you can use in an application or project. It can be written in CSS, Javascript, or some combination of both. Some common libraries: Google Fonts , Animate.css , Draggable.js , masonry.js , p5.js , D3.js , and Three.js . Framework A framework can be everything you use in application development. It can consist of both front-end and back-end toolsets. It can be a library, a collection of libraries, a collection of scripts, or any piece software you need to create an application. It's best to think about a framework as something that is mostly ready to use out of the box, but still requires an understanding of the terminal, version control, and the web languages: HTML, CSS, and JS. Some common frameworks: Bootstrap , W3.CSS , Materialize , Shoelace , React , Express , and Electron Framework . Evaluating a Library or Framework There are several questions you might ask yourself when choosing to use an existing library or framework. You typically start by looking at the documentation to compare similar features and components and to see if it does something you would like to incorporate into a project. What does it do? What's the benefit of using it? How do you use it? Pros and cons? Are there examples to follow? Is there a large community? Where can I get help?

It will use Bootstrap as the front-end framework and vanilla javascript to filter. References: Figma Design , Github Repo Goals: Learn how to incorporate a front-end library or framework into a project. Understand how to structure a document based on the framework used. Learn how to utilize Javascript to filter a list of items. In this case student names. Instructions: Create a new project folder called \"student-list\". Create an index.html file inside the folder. This will be your primary document. Open Terminal and start a live-server instance inside your project folder. Naviagate to the Bootstrap documentation and look for the Starter Template code. Copy and paste it into your index.html file. You should see an empty page that says Hello, World! in your browser automatically as long as live-server is running. Add a div element with the class=\"container\" inside your body element. All your content will go in here. Below the container div and just ablve the closing body tag, add a <script>... </script> element. This is where we will put all our Javascript code. Refer to the Figma Design to see what the page should look like. What elements will you need to make your document reflect the design in Figma? Tip: Look at the components section of the Bootstrap documentation. Once you have the general structure of the page, we can proceed to make it interactive when typing into the search field by using javascript. Proceed to implement a filter algorithm as described in class. Questions / Next Steps How do I add more data to the page? How do I update the data? Where is the data stored and how do I access it?

The modern term \"web application\" applies to a variety of systems or stacks. Typically, these systems communicate with one or more servers for access to system resources like memory, databases, and cpu or gpu. ie. speed, power, and connectivity. It may have more than one type of client interface. ie. Mobile, desktop, API, or another application. What are some common types of websites or web applications?

Thoughts on how to accomplish this: If you have project in mind for your final project or another project, begin to identify what tools you might use to build that project and attempt to work on a piece of it. What functionalites does the project need? (Maybe there's a library for it) How do you see the project working from the user experience? What design elements can you identify and how might they be coded? Investigate libraries that seem interesting to you. Assess their capabilities and how you can apply it to a project. Begin by looking over examples found in the documentation. Look for \"getting started\" documentation about a library or framework. Work through it and see where it takes you. Google is your best friend. Try to be as specific as possible when invesitgating a library or framework. What is your motivation for learning it and what do you want to accomplish with it? Identify some specific uses of it and focus. Start simple. Dont try to understand it all. If you copy and paste code from somewhere, copy one line at a time and learn what it does.

Choose an API to get familiar with and attempt to make something using it. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Continue down the path you came up with during class or develop a new approach. Spend some time researching APIs that are in line with products or services you are familiar with and use often. Research mashups that use an API you are exploring. What was done? Can it be improved? What are some of your hobbies and interests? Is there an API for it? If not, what if there was? Whats possible then? Write down the names of a bunch of APIs you research and put them into a hat. Stir it around and pull out two. Repeat this process for a time and write down all the combinations. What's interesting? Look for recent tutorials that make use of an API you are curious about. Attempt to recreate the workflow. Start with simple GET requests and increase the complexity of your queries as you get more familiar with the documentation and API. Work through the class examples and develop a workflow that enables you to work with data in a new way. For example, using Google Forms (for user data input) to generate a database (Google Sheet), which you then can pull data from via API.

In this course students will learn from the ground up how to utilize McNeel Rhinoceros with Grasshopper--a visual programming environment for algorithmic modeling, to design parametric systems and how to translate digital objects into physical form through 3D printing. Students will be introduced to the emerging field of parametric product design by developing projects that explore a multitude of form-finding strategies in surface patterning and complex geometric modeling of everyday objects spanning a variety of scales and applications. Familiar examples of product categories ripe for design experimentation include common objects such as pens and speakers, household items such as furniture and lighting, and personal items such as clothing, razors, and jewelry. In addition, students will develop an understanding of how to evaluate and optimize their designs based on product constraints, use cases, materiality, form, and function of physical objects produced through iterative cycles of production.

Node.js apps require a system that allows a Javascript runtime (process) to run all the time using a process management tool like PM2 .

Below are some tutorials from hosts that offer these kinds of servers.

To use: Navigate to your project directory: cd /Users/username/code Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git my-project-name This will clone the cm-sandbox repo into a new project folder named my-project-name . Now you have a starting point for a new web project running with live-server . If you plan to make any commits to a repo on Github with this new project folder you will need to create a repo on Github with the same project name and assign the remote to your repo. Assign a new remote to your new project repo. Assuming I have a new project folder called my-project-name and a new repo on Github with the same name, follow the steps below and replace the remote URL with your new repo URL. cd my-project-name git remote -v You will see something like this returned: origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (push) Copy the url to your new Github repo and use with the git remote command then push the changes to your repo. Check what the remote is set to by using the git remote command as above. It should be updated with your new project URL. Prior to pushing the changes you can make any edits to the files in the repo and add them and commit them. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/rjduran/my-project-name.git git remote -v git push -u origin master You can read more about changing remotes between HTTPS and SSH and vice versa here . How to Build a Sandbox Create a local development workspace (aka sandbox ) to prototype with HTML, CSS, and JS. By the end of this you should have something that looks like my cm-sandbox repo. What is the purpose of this? To become familiar with the file types, languages, and how they work together. At a fundamental level this approach to experimentation establishes good development practices and efficient workflows. It also supports hands-on learning, which is the only way to improve as a programmer. As a programmer you want to be in control of your code, tools, workflow, and system. ( Don't let the computer control you. ). Pro Tip: Setup a working directory for all programming projects (For Example, /Users/username/code ). This directory then becomes your goto location for anything having to do with code, programming, cloning repos from github, experimenting with new tools and software, and more. This is precisely how I organize my system. Download and install Node.js and live-server . Verify node and npm are installed via Terminal: node -v && npm -v . You should see two version numbers matching what you installed. Install live-server globally: npm install -g live-server If you have done all this correctly you should be able to type npm list -g --depth 0 and see that the live-server module has been installed. You can also type live-server in your terminal and start a server at the default address http://127.0.0.1:8080 from your current folder. Create a Github account and make a repository for your web project (as demonstrated in class). You can name the repo anything you want. For example, \"cm-sandbox\". Clone a copy of this repository to your machine via Terminal. git clone <repo-url> . Setup your machine to make use of a local development folder and local development server (See tip above and Step 1). Create 3 files in your web project repository folder (ie. the project \"folder\" or \"repo\" you created and then cloned from Github in step 3). index.html - ( quick boilerplate template , copy and paste code from here) style.css script.js Launch your local development server ( live-server ) via Terminal and code editor of choice (ex. VSCode) and make some changes to the files in your web project.

To use: Navigate to your project directory: cd /Users/username/code Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git my-project-name This will clone the cm-sandbox repo into a new project folder named my-project-name . Now you have a starting point for a new web project running with live-server . If you plan to make any commits to a repo on Github with this new project folder you will need to create a repo on Github with the same project name and assign the remote to your repo. Assign a new remote to your new project repo. Assuming I have a new project folder called my-project-name and a new repo on Github with the same name, follow the steps below and replace the remote URL with your new repo URL. cd my-project-name git remote -v You will see something like this returned: origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (push) Copy the url to your new Github repo and use with the git remote command then push the changes to your repo. Check what the remote is set to by using the git remote command as above. It should be updated with your new project URL. Prior to pushing the changes you can make any edits to the files in the repo and add them and commit them. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/rjduran/my-project-name.git git remote -v git push -u origin master You can read more about changing remotes between HTTPS and SSH and vice versa here .","title":"Critical Making Sandbox"},{"location":"dev/sandbox/#how-to-build-a-sandbox","text":"Create a local development workspace (aka sandbox ) to prototype with HTML, CSS, and JS. By the end of this you should have something that looks like my cm-sandbox repo. What is the purpose of this? To become familiar with the file types, languages, and how they work together. At a fundamental level this approach to experimentation establishes good development practices and efficient workflows. It also supports hands-on learning, which is the only way to improve as a programmer. As a programmer you want to be in control of your code, tools, workflow, and system. ( Don't let the computer control you. ). Pro Tip: Setup a working directory for all programming projects (For Example, /Users/username/code ). This directory then becomes your goto location for anything having to do with code, programming, cloning repos from github, experimenting with new tools and software, and more. This is precisely how I organize my system. Download and install Node.js and live-server . Verify node and npm are installed via Terminal: node -v && npm -v . You should see two version numbers matching what you installed. Install live-server globally: npm install -g live-server If you have done all this correctly you should be able to type npm list -g --depth 0 and see that the live-server module has been installed. You can also type live-server in your terminal and start a server at the default address http://127.0.0.1:8080 from your current folder. Create a Github account and make a repository for your web project (as demonstrated in class). You can name the repo anything you want. For example, \"cm-sandbox\". Clone a copy of this repository to your machine via Terminal. git clone <repo-url> . Setup your machine to make use of a local development folder and local development server (See tip above and Step 1). Create 3 files in your web project repository folder (ie. the project \"folder\" or \"repo\" you created and then cloned from Github in step 3). index.html - ( quick boilerplate template , copy and paste code from here) style.css script.js Launch your local development server ( live-server ) via Terminal and code editor of choice (ex. VSCode) and make some changes to the files in your web project. Remember the purpose of a local development environment is to \"simulate\" how the code will perform when uploaded to another web server. Open a browser and goto the url shown. It will be http://localhost:8080 or something similar. Create a basic html page using validated markup (Hint: Using a tool like FreeFormatter , check that your code works as expected.)

What is a GIF? At a basic level, a GIF is an animated image made up of a series of images or frames of a video. It's typically very small in size, which means the quality is far less than standard or high definition video and often appears a bit grainy if highly compressed. They are useful for sharing bite-size bundles of visual content. For instance, say you are trying to share a visual concept or UI design as a series of short animations.

Getting Started Before you can write blog posts you need a place to put the blog posts you write. Most students in the program choose to use Medium because other courses make use of it for assignments, but you can use any platform you wish. Take a look at some alternatives under Blogs, Wikis, and Content Management Systems (CMS) if you would like to use another tool. Once you have a blog, you are ready to write posts. You can follow the criteria below and customize for any deliverable. What's in a post? A title that clearly describes the subject matter. It is recommended that a post includes a variety of media and content to support the subject matter. For example: text, images, video, graphics, photos, mockups, screen captures, tutorials, 3d model viewers (sketchfab), sketches, code, gifs, references, etc. Anything that is required to effectively communicate the details of a project, process, prototype, or idea. The subject matter is in response to the topics of the week. Ideally, it falls in line with your interests, research area, project, creative process, etc. For example, you might consider doing a series of tutorials on a topic that interests you or a process/workflow you are currently exploring through the course.

Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran\u2019s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at: http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html and at http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs Disability If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions: Injuries, Surgeries, and Illnesses guidelines under Quick Links at Disability Services website and discuss your needs with your professor. Religious Observance Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. Please notify me as quickly as possible regarding any possible absences so that we can plan your work accordingly. See full details at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html Discrimination and Harassment The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. The University of Colorado does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational programs and activities.

CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, \"Protected Classes\" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or veteran status. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be obtained at http://hr.colorado.edu/dh/ Honor Code All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and at http://honorcode.colorado.edu Athletic Events The Boulder Campus has two separate but similar policies governing conflicts between a student's athletic events and his or her classes and exams. One policy governs students involved in intercollegiate varsity athletic events. The other policy governs students involved in Club Sports events. Each policy is accompanied by a detailed report with guidance on how instructors may deal with conflicts when they arise. Both policies may be viewed in detail on the Boulder Faculty Assembly's website: Policy on conflicts involving Intercollegiate Athletics, http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/committees/IAC.html Policy on conflicts involving Club Sports http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/committees/studentaffairs.html The two policies are substantially similar, having the following terms in common: That it is the student's responsibility to notify each instructor, in the first week of the semester and in writing, about any known conflicts between academic requirements and athletic events. That instructors have full authority to decide whether and/or how to accommodate those conflicts. While an instructor has the right to refuse to make accommodations, he or she is permitted to provide such accommodations. That coaches are forbidden from initiating contact with instructors regarding schedule conflicts, grades, or academic progress. The Intercollegiate Athletics Office of Academic Support Services and the Recreation Center's Collegiate Club Sports coordinators may contact instructors about certain topics. There is no rule preventing faculty from contacting these support organizations.Policy terms that are specific to intercollegiate varsity events, as opposed to club sports events, include: That intercollegiate varsity athletic events during final exams, which are normally forbidden by university policy, must be approved in writing by the BFA Intercollegiate Athletics Committee well in advance of the event. Students involved in these events must then work with their instructors in regard to any missed work.","title":"CU Policies and Procedures"},{"location":"studio-handbook/policies/#cu-policies-and-procedures","text":"","title":"CU Policies and Procedures"},{"location":"studio-handbook/policies/#classroom-behavior","text":"Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment.
