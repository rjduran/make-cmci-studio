Fall 2020 Operations CU Boulder Campus Map Hours Workshop Schedule BLDG61: Boulder Library Makerspace BLDG 61 is a free community workshop that provides maker education and technology to the public in a creative and inclusive environment. They are located nearby, just down the street from our studio. They offer a variety of free workshops and access to tools and knowledge within the larger Boulder community. I highly recommend becoming familiar with their space. Learn more at https://boulderlibrary.org/bldg61/ . Course Workload The CM1 is a 3 credit hour course. You should expect to dedicate at least 2-3 hours per credit hour. This translates into a 6-9 hours per week. Consider 6 hours a minimum expectation for one studio course and plan accordingly with your other studio courses. Assignments for the course consist of weekly blog posts demonstrating project-based and process oriented research and explorations in making . Assignment parameters will be based on the topic of the week and \"due\" the following week by the start of class time. Refer to the Course Deliverables section for more information. The course is organized into weekly meetings consisting of instructor led project-driven topics organized as workshops and studio work sessions. It is expected that all students are active participants in each session. Course Deliverables CM1 is a project based course and largely driven by student research and interests. As such, each deliverable is expected to vary based on the project parameters and requirements. The following outlines the general criteria for course deliverables throughout the semester. Assignments Assignments are given weekly and need to be submitted as a blog post published to your Critical Making blog. A minimum of 1 blog post per week is the expectation. Medium is widely used in other studio classes but any blogging platform may be used. Posts are to be submitted via slack #cmstudio by the specified due date each week. It is recommended that a post includes a variety of media and content to support the subject matter. For example: text, images, video, graphics, photos, mockups, screen captures, tutorials, 3d model viewers (sketchfab), sketches, code, gifs, references, etc. Anything that is required to effectively communicate the details of a project, process, prototype, or idea. The subject matter is in response to the topics of the week. Ideally, it falls in line with your interests, research area, project, creative process, etc. For example, you might consider doing a series of tutorials on a topic that interests you or a process/workflow you are currently exploring through the course. Posts should be written to the best of your abilities and for a public audience. The post and any accompanying visual content (images, video) may be shared on social media.

Such a map might be a timeline, visualization, info graphic, mind map, photographic series, video, written document, or any combination of these formats. Include your interests and pursuits in CMCI Studio. Questions: What led you to CMCI Studio? What is your question? Based on the survey, what do you feel strong in and what are you excited to learn more about through this course? Where do you see yourself by the end of the program? If you could design and build anything, what would it be? Resources Mind Mapping Part 2: Things I Like & Dislike Choose 3 things you like (or love) and 3 things you dislike (or hate) and describe what they mean to you and why. Possible choices might be products, objects, artifacts, or experiences. Be wary of pointing out behaviors in people or circumstances beyond your control or judgement. Focus on the tangible attributes that you can clearly articulate. Questions: What\u2019s their story? Who made them and why? Why do or did they exist? Why do you find them intriguing or despise them? Deliverable: Write and submit a blog post for Part 1 and Part 2 on your blog. Include any media in your post that supports your thoughts and ideas. Share a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio by Sept 7 (Labor Day). Due: Sept 7 Week 2: Tools for Development Aug 31 | Location: Zoom Meeting Today in class we will be working on setting up software and becoming familiar with some of the tools used for development. Questions Assignment #2 begins today Class Format over Zoom Break out rooms? Setting up your development environment What's that and why do we need it? What does a development environment look like? IDE's vs Text Editors, working code folder, Terminal, Node.js, NPM, Version Control. The combination of all these tools is what I refer to as a \"sandbox\" or local development environment. Terminal Workshop Hello Terminal Basic folder navigation and file creation Moving From Bash to Zsh: Terminal Changes in macOS Catalina Showing hidden files on your system \"dot\" files (aka a file with a dot or period at the beginning of it's filename is a hidden file) Install Git Github Workshop Version Control (aka a time machine for code/data) Setup Github account Create your first repo Markdown Setup local development environment Make a Sandbox (aka local dev server environment) Play in the sandbox by making a basic HTML webpage and serving it up Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software ASCII vs Binary Files ASCII - Data for a human to read/write Binary - Data for a computer to read/write Development Environment Lets get started by setting up a development environment. The most basic things you need for any web development tasks are a text editor and a browser like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Other tools such as the Terminal, Git, Github, and Node.js enable you to work with all sorts of libraries and frameworks, collaborate with others, and quickly prototype new ideas. All these tools come together under the idea of running a \"local development server\" or localhost on your machine. We will be setting up all these parts and will utilize them in different ways over the course of the semester. If you are curious about the history of electronics, computers, computer science, programming, and the Internet, check out the Histories section. I strongly advise you to start getting familiar with the various histories and technological underpinnings of the technologies you use every day. Remember, it's also about building awareness and understanding about the systems that run our world. These resources are meant to work through at your own speed and as you begin to ask deeper questions about why something works and how something works. I also highly recommend the book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold. It is a foundational text on why computers are the way they are and how they work, beginning with code. Text Editors What is a text editor? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? When it comes to web development or software development work, you need a text editor capable of working with ASCII data and rich in features supporting development tasks. My editor of choice is currently Visual Studio Code (VSCode) . Will Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages work? No! These are word processing applications that deal primarily with binary data because in addition to the actual text information stored in a .doc file, it encapsulates data such as font and formatting. Don't use these editors for this kind of work. You will be sad. Terminal Workshop What is the Terminal? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? Goals: Get familiar with the terminal by creating and manipulating files and folders on your system. Set up git to be able to use version control to manage projects on Github. Terminal 101 Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app For the Windows users: Cmder is a Terminal emulator that works in a similar way to the mac terminal. How to display hidden files on MacOS Customize your Terminal in Terminal > Preferences. It helps to make the text larger on most screens. Common commands: cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm, mv, cp, pwd, man, touch . Think of all these commands as tiny applications that have no GUI. They are very old and have been around since the start of Unix based systems (Read this to learn more: Looking back at OS X's origins ). Look at MacOS/Linux/Unix Command Line Cheat Sheet to see more information about common commands. Working with directories and files: cd <folder> - Goto into a folder cd .. - Go up one level cd ../<folder> - Go up one level (to parent folder) and into a child folder cd ../.. - Go up two levels etc Tab completion - When you start typing in a terminal you can hit tab to complete the command if the file or folder you are going to use is available. If you hit Tab twice, you will see the contents of a folder. Getting out of or killing a process that is running in Terminal: ctrl + c Install Git You will likely not have Git installed on your machine by default. You will know if you have it or not when you type git into the Terminal. If you do have it installed you will see information about how to use it. If you don't, you will see the output \"command not found\". You may be prompted to install XCode Developer Tools when installing git. Accept the install and proceed. You have two options to install git: Install the XCode Developer tools (easy way) or download the installer from git-scm . After installing it the git command should work in the Terminal. This is essential to working with Github. Resources Learning Terminal - Cheetsheets and more! Learning Git How to use Terminal on Mac , How to use a Terminal on Windows Command Line Cheat Sheet by git-tower - This one is great for both git and terminal commands! Github Workshop Goals: Setup a Github account Create your first repository Publish some code to it How to Use Github Sign up for a Github account . Choose a username wisely. You might just be \"Internet famous\" someday. ( Stuck on choosing a username? Read this. A Tale of Github Usernames ) Create a hello-world repo on Github . If you check the box to add a README file it will include a README.md file in the repo. This is the main information file shown when you goto the repo URL Markdown = text file with special syntax that gets converted into HTML. Review Markdown Cheatsheet . Complete list of github markdown emoji markup Clone your repo using the terminal. Doing this will download a copy of your repository onto your machine. Clone Repo: git clone <repo url> . For Example, git clone git@github.com:rjduran/cm-sandbox.git . Note the URL and its use of \"git\" or \"https\". Use \"https\" to start. You need to go through the Github tutorial below in step #4 to connect to Github via SSH. Open VSCode and add the cloned folder to the workspace Make some changes to your README.md file using VSCode Stage the changes: git add . or git add README.md Commit the changes: git commit -m \"my message describing changes\" Push the changes: git push You will be asked for your username and password when attempting to push changes to your repo at this stage. Once the changes are uploaded you will see the changes on the Github page for the repo. Yay! Good times! Success! Pro tip: After setting up your Github account, read through Connecting to Github with SSH to setup your system to connect securely to Github and not require you to enter your username and password credentials each time you push changes. Assignment 2: Everyday Project Objective: Make something and capture a digital representation of it each day for the next 2 weeks. You should have at a minimum 14 objects. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Choose any tool(s) at your disposal. Choose any theme or topic. Date Range: Monday Aug 31 to Monday Sept 14 Decide how you will document your project. For example, Instagram, blog post, a single image, a document, a Github repo commit, a video, etc. Consider how the result will travel digitally. Refer to the projects and practices you observed from last week. Questions: What do you already make and want to make more of? What new thing has peaked your interest and will you use to make something every day? Deliverable: Submit a blog post documenting your project process and outcome in Slack #cmstudio . Due: Sept 14 Week 3: Labor Day Sept 7 Labor Day, No Class Phase 2: The Modern Web In this phase we will talk about web development paradigms and practices and you will build your web development skills inside and outside of class. We will approach each topic with simplicity in mind and focus on understanding fundamental concepts. To build advanced skills with the tools we discuss you will need to dedicate time outside of class for further experimentation. We will approach topics in a hands-on workshop format so be prepared to dive in. If you do have some web development experience coming into the program think about some new aspects of development you are curious about such as libraries, frameworks, responsiveness, interactivity, animations, Javascript, types of tech stacks, or just how you can improve your skills in what you know through practice. The goal of this phase is to gain a sense of how you can utilize web technologies to solve problems. Week 4: Intro to Web Development Sept 14 | Location: Zoom Meeting CMCI Equipment Resources Assignments 1,2 Share Terminal, Git/Github Questions Github: How do I make a copy of a repo into another folder? Github: How do I assign a different remote to a repo? Repo for this phase: https://github.com/rjduran/cm1-web-dev The World Wide Web What is the World Wide Web and what is its purpose? The purpose of building websites and web applications is to make an idea accessible to people. While we won't look into the history of the Internet very much, it's still worth spending some time reading more about the innovations and contributions to the Internet as we know it today under the History of the Internet section. The Industry What do web developers do? Collaborate, write code, evaluate new tools, solve technical problems, synthesize, make prototypes. What do web developers need to know? At a minimum the 3 web languages, HTML, CSS, and JS. Beyond this it really depends on the project or idea. Many choose to specialize in different kinds of tech stacks supporting front-end development, back-end development, or full-stack development. Learning how to learn and apply technical skills is your best asset. How do you learn web development skills? Make lots of web things to practice. Make lots of mistakes to learn. Pick up books on the subject. Watch tutorial videos on development topics. Read blogs like those below and try everything you read about. In this ever evolving field you are constantly learning new tools and workflows. Stacks & Maps These resources are for you to investigate the world of development. Think of them as maps to learning about different roles and technologies. Front End, Back End, Full Stack\u2014What Does it All Mean? Front-End vs Back-End vs Full-Stack on Udacity A Guide to Becoming a Full-Stack Developer in 2017 - If you only read one of these, read this one. How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016 - Read through this and see if you can begin to make sense of the current development ecosystem. (Note: Its complex and a little bit insane but this guy makes a good (fun) read of it.) The 2019 Roadmap To Fullstack Web Development The 2019 Web Developer Roadmap - Has some great flowcharts showing how different technologies relate / Github Source . - Look at these maps if you want to see the big picture. Web Languages Workshop | In Class, 45 mins Webpages are constructed in 3 languages - HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Modern browsers will render pages built in these languages more or less the same depending on the viewport size and device orientation. In the resources below you can find some learning pathways for building skills with these tools. Make time to read through the basics of all the languages and try things out. Most importantly, seek to apply the skills you are learning towards projects. How does a web language relate to what a user sees? HTML = Document Structure CSS = Visual Language (Layout, Identity) JS = Interactivity & Dynamics What IS the composition of a webpage? At a basic level all you need is a single index.html file with <html>...</html> and enclosing <body>...</body> tag to render a webpage. All the CSS and JS you may have can exist inside the same file embedded within <style>...</style> and <script>...</script> elements. It only becomes important to separate the 3 types of code when a project becomes too large to manage within a single file, which is very common. Best practices, modularity, and the need for regular maintenance have led developers and designers towards a current approach of establishing and using style guides or coding standards . Exercise 1: Hello HTML Goals: Understand how to make a basic HTML document using a text editor (VS Code) Understand how to structure a document for HTML, CSS, and JS Understand how to use the browser for viewing a page Instructions: Make a new folder called \"hello-world\" for your project files. Pro Tip: Setup a dedicated code folder for all your code based projects. I use one called code inside my home directory (/Users/rjduran or ~/). Open VS Code and add the \"hello-world\" folder to your workspace. Using VS Code make a new file called index.html in your project folder. Open Chrome and open the index.html file. You should see a blank page. This is your document without any content. In VS Code, add the html, head, and body tags into the document. What are these tags used for? In VS Code, add a few elements such as h1, h2, p, a, and img into the document body. What are these tags used for? Toggle between Chrome and VS Code to see your changes rendered in the browser. CMD + R to reload the page in Chrome. Exercise 2: Hello CSS Goals: Understand how to add CSS to a HTML document (internal & external) Understand how to use CSS selectors - element, .class, #id Get familiar with how to use CSS properties Exercise 3: Hello JS Goals: Understand how to add JS to a HTML document (internal & external) Get familiar with how JS can modify the contents of a page Get familiar with how to utilize the Chrome Dev Tools console Resources W3 Schools HTML Reference W3 Schools CSS Reference W3 Schools JS Tutorial BREAK - Take 10 min Website Analysis Workshop | Breakout Rooms, 20 mins Goals: Get familiar with the Elements tab in Chrome development tools Understand the general structure of a HTML document Understand how HTML and CSS create visual heirarchy and organization Instructions: Choose one of the Bootstrap examples to inspect. Using the Chrome development tools, inspect the site. Look at the HTML elements and the overall structure of the page. Chrome Developer Tools (Inspector for debugging). Access via: View > Developer > Developer Tools within Chrome. What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Make a quick wireframe sketch on paper of the page you are inspecting. Label the different parts of the page using common terminology (ie. header, sidebar, footer, post, etc) and HTML tags with opening and closing characters( < , > ). What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Identify 2-3 HTML tags and look up their meaning on W3 Schools HTML Element Reference . Share your findings with the group. Exit breakout room and discuss your findings. Local Development Workshop | In Class, 30 mins Goals: Setup a local development server aka Sandbox. We will follow the instructions under How to build a Sandbox . Get familiar with starting / stopping a local server in the terminal Understand the development workflow Instructions: Once your live-server is setup, launch an instance and open the browser. Make an edit to your index.html file and view the changes in the browser. Try launching a second server from another terminal window. What happens? Resources Example: hello-live-server Assignment 3: Ode to Things Choose one (or more) every day object(s) in your life and make a simple website for it / them. You might consider the site as a container for a favored item or collection of things, a product to sell, or simply a site that pays tribute to the item or object and what it means to you in life. This idea was inspired by the website Ode to Things , which is an e-commerce store and curated collection of physical every day products. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Build a webpage from scratch that makes use of html elements and css selectors. Use necessary html elements that act as containers for different types of content and page heirarchy: text, images, video, etc. Develop your webpage using a local development environment aka live-server. When done, make a repository on Github for your project and commit the required index.html file and and any media files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result. Hint: The repo should look similar to the hello-world folder and files you created in class. It should also include a README.md file since you always include this text file with any Github repo you create. Advanced Option: If you are feeling comfortable with HTML and CSS, explore an aspect of HTML or CSS that is new to you or take the leap into Javascript or using a front-end framework. Deliverable: A short 1-2 min video screen capture demonstrating your website running in a local development environment as setup in class. Be sure to briefly introduce yourself and your project, provide an overview of what you made and how it works. Embed the video into your blog post. Pro Tip: If you are new to screen capture tools, look into using Screencast-o-matic or the built in screen capture tools of MacOS (CMD + Shift + 5) to document your workflow. Create an account with Youtube and upload your video. Include a link to your Github repo for the code written. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience. What hurdles did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What worked and what didn't? What new tools did you try? How would you explain what you've done to someone that doesn't know anything about web development and the tools used? Submit a link to your post on Slack #cmstudio .

Questions Assignment #2 begins today Class Format over Zoom Break out rooms? Setting up your development environment What's that and why do we need it? What does a development environment look like? IDE's vs Text Editors, working code folder, Terminal, Node.js, NPM, Version Control. The combination of all these tools is what I refer to as a \"sandbox\" or local development environment. Terminal Workshop Hello Terminal Basic folder navigation and file creation Moving From Bash to Zsh: Terminal Changes in macOS Catalina Showing hidden files on your system \"dot\" files (aka a file with a dot or period at the beginning of it's filename is a hidden file) Install Git Github Workshop Version Control (aka a time machine for code/data) Setup Github account Create your first repo Markdown Setup local development environment Make a Sandbox (aka local dev server environment) Play in the sandbox by making a basic HTML webpage and serving it up Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software ASCII vs Binary Files ASCII - Data for a human to read/write Binary - Data for a computer to read/write Development Environment Lets get started by setting up a development environment. The most basic things you need for any web development tasks are a text editor and a browser like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Other tools such as the Terminal, Git, Github, and Node.js enable you to work with all sorts of libraries and frameworks, collaborate with others, and quickly prototype new ideas. All these tools come together under the idea of running a \"local development server\" or localhost on your machine. We will be setting up all these parts and will utilize them in different ways over the course of the semester. If you are curious about the history of electronics, computers, computer science, programming, and the Internet, check out the Histories section. I strongly advise you to start getting familiar with the various histories and technological underpinnings of the technologies you use every day. Remember, it's also about building awareness and understanding about the systems that run our world. These resources are meant to work through at your own speed and as you begin to ask deeper questions about why something works and how something works. I also highly recommend the book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold. It is a foundational text on why computers are the way they are and how they work, beginning with code. Text Editors What is a text editor? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? When it comes to web development or software development work, you need a text editor capable of working with ASCII data and rich in features supporting development tasks. My editor of choice is currently Visual Studio Code (VSCode) . Will Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages work? No! These are word processing applications that deal primarily with binary data because in addition to the actual text information stored in a .doc file, it encapsulates data such as font and formatting. Don't use these editors for this kind of work. You will be sad. Terminal Workshop What is the Terminal? What is it's purpose? How is it useful for development? Goals: Get familiar with the terminal by creating and manipulating files and folders on your system. Set up git to be able to use version control to manage projects on Github. Terminal 101 Location on MacOS: Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app For the Windows users: Cmder is a Terminal emulator that works in a similar way to the mac terminal. How to display hidden files on MacOS Customize your Terminal in Terminal > Preferences. It helps to make the text larger on most screens. Common commands: cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm, mv, cp, pwd, man, touch . Think of all these commands as tiny applications that have no GUI. They are very old and have been around since the start of Unix based systems (Read this to learn more: Looking back at OS X's origins ). Look at MacOS/Linux/Unix Command Line Cheat Sheet to see more information about common commands. Working with directories and files: cd <folder> - Goto into a folder cd .. - Go up one level cd ../<folder> - Go up one level (to parent folder) and into a child folder cd ../.. - Go up two levels etc Tab completion - When you start typing in a terminal you can hit tab to complete the command if the file or folder you are going to use is available. If you hit Tab twice, you will see the contents of a folder. Getting out of or killing a process that is running in Terminal: ctrl + c Install Git You will likely not have Git installed on your machine by default. You will know if you have it or not when you type git into the Terminal. If you do have it installed you will see information about how to use it. If you don't, you will see the output \"command not found\". You may be prompted to install XCode Developer Tools when installing git. Accept the install and proceed. You have two options to install git: Install the XCode Developer tools (easy way) or download the installer from git-scm . After installing it the git command should work in the Terminal. This is essential to working with Github. Resources Learning Terminal - Cheetsheets and more! Learning Git How to use Terminal on Mac , How to use a Terminal on Windows Command Line Cheat Sheet by git-tower - This one is great for both git and terminal commands! Github Workshop Goals: Setup a Github account Create your first repository Publish some code to it How to Use Github Sign up for a Github account . Choose a username wisely. You might just be \"Internet famous\" someday. ( Stuck on choosing a username? Read this. A Tale of Github Usernames ) Create a hello-world repo on Github . If you check the box to add a README file it will include a README.md file in the repo. This is the main information file shown when you goto the repo URL Markdown = text file with special syntax that gets converted into HTML. Review Markdown Cheatsheet . Complete list of github markdown emoji markup Clone your repo using the terminal. Doing this will download a copy of your repository onto your machine. Clone Repo: git clone <repo url> . For Example, git clone git@github.com:rjduran/cm-sandbox.git . Note the URL and its use of \"git\" or \"https\". Use \"https\" to start. You need to go through the Github tutorial below in step #4 to connect to Github via SSH. Open VSCode and add the cloned folder to the workspace Make some changes to your README.md file using VSCode Stage the changes: git add . or git add README.md Commit the changes: git commit -m \"my message describing changes\" Push the changes: git push You will be asked for your username and password when attempting to push changes to your repo at this stage. Once the changes are uploaded you will see the changes on the Github page for the repo. Yay! Good times! Success!

The purpose of building websites and web applications is to make an idea accessible to people. While we won't look into the history of the Internet very much, it's still worth spending some time reading more about the innovations and contributions to the Internet as we know it today under the History of the Internet section. The Industry What do web developers do? Collaborate, write code, evaluate new tools, solve technical problems, synthesize, make prototypes. What do web developers need to know? At a minimum the 3 web languages, HTML, CSS, and JS. Beyond this it really depends on the project or idea. Many choose to specialize in different kinds of tech stacks supporting front-end development, back-end development, or full-stack development. Learning how to learn and apply technical skills is your best asset. How do you learn web development skills? Make lots of web things to practice. Make lots of mistakes to learn. Pick up books on the subject. Watch tutorial videos on development topics. Read blogs like those below and try everything you read about. In this ever evolving field you are constantly learning new tools and workflows. Stacks & Maps These resources are for you to investigate the world of development. Think of them as maps to learning about different roles and technologies. Front End, Back End, Full Stack\u2014What Does it All Mean?

The 2019 Roadmap To Fullstack Web Development The 2019 Web Developer Roadmap - Has some great flowcharts showing how different technologies relate / Github Source . - Look at these maps if you want to see the big picture. Web Languages Workshop | In Class, 45 mins Webpages are constructed in 3 languages - HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Modern browsers will render pages built in these languages more or less the same depending on the viewport size and device orientation. In the resources below you can find some learning pathways for building skills with these tools. Make time to read through the basics of all the languages and try things out. Most importantly, seek to apply the skills you are learning towards projects. How does a web language relate to what a user sees? HTML = Document Structure CSS = Visual Language (Layout, Identity) JS = Interactivity & Dynamics What IS the composition of a webpage? At a basic level all you need is a single index.html file with <html>...</html> and enclosing <body>...</body> tag to render a webpage. All the CSS and JS you may have can exist inside the same file embedded within <style>...</style> and <script>...</script> elements. It only becomes important to separate the 3 types of code when a project becomes too large to manage within a single file, which is very common. Best practices, modularity, and the need for regular maintenance have led developers and designers towards a current approach of establishing and using style guides or coding standards . Exercise 1: Hello HTML Goals: Understand how to make a basic HTML document using a text editor (VS Code) Understand how to structure a document for HTML, CSS, and JS Understand how to use the browser for viewing a page Instructions: Make a new folder called \"hello-world\" for your project files. Pro Tip: Setup a dedicated code folder for all your code based projects. I use one called code inside my home directory (/Users/rjduran or ~/). Open VS Code and add the \"hello-world\" folder to your workspace. Using VS Code make a new file called index.html in your project folder. Open Chrome and open the index.html file. You should see a blank page. This is your document without any content. In VS Code, add the html, head, and body tags into the document. What are these tags used for? In VS Code, add a few elements such as h1, h2, p, a, and img into the document body. What are these tags used for? Toggle between Chrome and VS Code to see your changes rendered in the browser. CMD + R to reload the page in Chrome. Exercise 2: Hello CSS Goals: Understand how to add CSS to a HTML document (internal & external) Understand how to use CSS selectors - element, .class, #id Get familiar with how to use CSS properties Exercise 3: Hello JS Goals: Understand how to add JS to a HTML document (internal & external) Get familiar with how JS can modify the contents of a page Get familiar with how to utilize the Chrome Dev Tools console Resources W3 Schools HTML Reference W3 Schools CSS Reference W3 Schools JS Tutorial BREAK - Take 10 min Website Analysis Workshop | Breakout Rooms, 20 mins Goals: Get familiar with the Elements tab in Chrome development tools Understand the general structure of a HTML document Understand how HTML and CSS create visual heirarchy and organization Instructions: Choose one of the Bootstrap examples to inspect. Using the Chrome development tools, inspect the site. Look at the HTML elements and the overall structure of the page. Chrome Developer Tools (Inspector for debugging). Access via: View > Developer > Developer Tools within Chrome. What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Make a quick wireframe sketch on paper of the page you are inspecting. Label the different parts of the page using common terminology (ie. header, sidebar, footer, post, etc) and HTML tags with opening and closing characters( < , > ). What do you notice? Discuss with your group. Identify 2-3 HTML tags and look up their meaning on W3 Schools HTML Element Reference . Share your findings with the group. Exit breakout room and discuss your findings. Local Development Workshop | In Class, 30 mins Goals: Setup a local development server aka Sandbox. We will follow the instructions under How to build a Sandbox . Get familiar with starting / stopping a local server in the terminal Understand the development workflow Instructions: Once your live-server is setup, launch an instance and open the browser. Make an edit to your index.html file and view the changes in the browser. Try launching a second server from another terminal window. What happens? Resources Example: hello-live-server","title":"Week 4: Intro to Web Development"},{"location":"APRD-5005/#assignment-3-ode-to-things","text":"Choose one (or more) every day object(s) in your life and make a simple website for it / them. You might consider the site as a container for a favored item or collection of things, a product to sell, or simply a site that pays tribute to the item or object and what it means to you in life. This idea was inspired by the website Ode to Things , which is an e-commerce store and curated collection of physical every day products. Thoughts on how to accomplish this: Build a webpage from scratch that makes use of html elements and css selectors. Use necessary html elements that act as containers for different types of content and page heirarchy: text, images, video, etc. Develop your webpage using a local development environment aka live-server. When done, make a repository on Github for your project and commit the required index.html file and and any media files to it. I should be able to clone your project repo and run it in a localhost on my machine to see the same result. Hint: The repo should look similar to the hello-world folder and files you created in class. It should also include a README.md file since you always include this text file with any Github repo you create. Advanced Option: If you are feeling comfortable with HTML and CSS, explore an aspect of HTML or CSS that is new to you or take the leap into Javascript or using a front-end framework. Deliverable: A short 1-2 min video screen capture demonstrating your website running in a local development environment as setup in class. Be sure to briefly introduce yourself and your project, provide an overview of what you made and how it works. Embed the video into your blog post. Pro Tip: If you are new to screen capture tools, look into using Screencast-o-matic or the built in screen capture tools of MacOS (CMD + Shift + 5) to document your workflow. Create an account with Youtube and upload your video. Include a link to your Github repo for the code written. A brief writeup on your blog about your learning experience.

Course Repo You will be able to find the examples we talk about in class here. Course Repo: CM2-IMD Workload This is a 3 credit hour course. You should expect to dedicate at least 2-3 hours per credit hour. This translates into a 6-9 hours per week. Consider 6 hours a minimum expectation for one studio course and plan accordingly with your other studio courses. Deliverables for the course consist of \" Looking Outwards \" Reports, Workouts , Projects , and a Final Project . These are to be submitted weekly as blog posts on the due date specified each week. In general, assignment parameters will be based on the topics of the week and due the following week by the start of class time. Refer to the Deliverables section for more detail. The course is organized into weekly meetings consisting of instructor led project-driven topics organized as workshops and studio work sessions. It is expected that all students are active participants in each session. This course will require considerable effort outside of class time. Plan work sessions with others as much as possible and be sure to take care of your mind and body so as not to get too stressed or overexert yourself. If you should need assistance managing stress or otherwise, you can get in touch with CAPS . Deliverables This is an experimental project based course, largely driven by student research and interests. Each week will follow a similar format when it comes to finding balance between theory and practice. It's expected that each student has varying skills and interests upon entering the course and are excited to expand on them and apply them towards their areas of interest. The course deliverables consist of \" Looking Outwards \" Reports to discover the emerging boundaries of XR and report on them, Workouts to develop skills in 3D asset creation, C# scripting, and modern XR toolkits, Projects to put research findings into practice and exercise creative faculties, and a Final Project to design and build a functional XR experience. Each deliverable is expected to vary based on the area of interest and parameters defined. The following outlines the general criteria for course deliverables throughout the semester. Looking Outwards What is a \"Looking Outwards\" Report? It's basically a blog post containing your research, thoughts, and ideas on a particular topic of interest. This means you should be looking at a variety of information sources such as blogs, emerging tech news, research papers, design/art/tech focused websites, tutorials, etc. covering the topics listed under Course Themes and reporting on what you find each week. These kinds of reports are due almost every week as noted in the schedule and count towards 10% of your final grade. This approach is inspired by Prof. Golan Levin's Looking Outwards Reports for the course Interactivity & Computation at CMU School of Art. Why are we doing these? Reason 1: I literally can\u2019t keep up with the changes taking place in the various fields related to XR and I need your help. Many hands make light work. You are the pioneers of this class and are tasked with discovering content and creating documentation that adds to the field of Immersive Media Design. Reason 2: We need to build a body of documentation that connect several disparate fields. Conducting research across several fields will uncover new and interesting opportunities for us. Throughout the semester I will document our collective findings under Looking Outwards (found in the left sidebar under CM 2 IMD). Workouts What is a \"Workout\"? A workout is some kind of weekly exercise that aims to practice and build skills. It's just what it sounds like, a way to work your \"muscles.\" What form do these take? They can take the form of reading technical documentation, writing code, solving a design challenge, trying out new software, and working through video tutorials that challenge and enable practice of concepts discussed in class. These are not graded but are highly recommended because they will provide greater understanding of a specific topic through focused hands-on practice. You may write blog posts for the workouts you do to help document your progress and process but it's not required. Projects What is a Project? A project aims to solve a problem or accomplish a goal using tools and skills. What form do these take? They are largely based on the topics explored in class, through the workouts, and through your research. They allow you to dig into and expand on a topic that interests you within the field of Immersive Media Design. They can be thought of as mini-projects to build towards developing your final project or one-off experiments exploring a particular technique or software workflow you are interested in. Projects are due every few weeks as noted on the schedule and count towards 40% of your final grade. Final Project Read more about writing a project proposal and final project deliverables here . Grading & Evaluation Grades for the course follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown. Type Percentage of Grade Looking Outwards 10 % Workouts Not graded Projects 40 % Final Project 50 % Work is evaluated based on the following: Done vs Not Done. Done gets credit, Not Done does not get credit. Quality and Quantity of deliverables. This studio based course requires a healthy level of creative immersion and balance to be successful. Explore your creative process through making and always deliver to the best of your abilities. Achieve quality through quantity. Engagement with the subject matter. If something isn't interesting to you, make it interesting. Clarity of documentation. Make it easy for others to read and understand. Collaboration will also be a factor of evaluation if you choose to work on projects in teams of no more than 3-4 people. The division of duties on any project needs to be clearly defined and documented by all team members and will factor into individual evaluations. Week 1: Overview Jan 17 (Friday) Overview of Course Course Deliverables IMD Setup Guide Mobile Devices Survey DCMP VR Lab Tour - Friday Jan 31, 9:30-10:30am Signup Form VR and AR Hardware & Software Overview There are various ways to get started with VR and AR at this point in time. Too many in fact. It can be difficult to know where to begin. For the majority of this class we will be focused on Unity, XCode, Cinema4D, and C# Scripting with Visual Studio or VSCode. For hardware we have several HTC Vive units, a desktop PC and two laptop PCs capable of running any VR experience you build. You also have access to the DCMP VR Lab to develop experiences. Looking at the results from the mobile device survey you filled out, most people seem to have a recent Apple iPhone capable of supporting AR Kit. Yay!

Identify 2-3 creatives (story tellers, designers, developers, coders, etc) that are making interesting digital content or VR and/or AR based media or works. * What are they making? * Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow. What's inspiring about the work? * What kinds of tools are they using? Share a link to your post with user group **@imd** in Slack channel **#cmstudio**. **_Due: Jan 27_** ???+ example \"Workout [0]: Getting Started\" 1. This week you need to download and install the required software listed in the [IMD Setup Guide](/guides/imd-setup-guide/). 2. You should start exploring any of the tools through the freely available and built in documentation, tutorials, and guides. Adobe, Cinema4D, Unity, and XCode have large user communities and great documentation to get started. My suggestion is to start getting familiar with Unity since much of the work we do will end up in there. I suggest looking in the Unity tutorials for a Foundational tutorial or Creator Kit tutorial that interests you to work through over the next week. Getting Started with Unity * [learn.unity.com](https://learn.unity.com/) * [Creator Kit: Puzzle](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-puzzle) * [Projects](https://learn.unity.com/projects) * [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) Week 2: No Class Jan 20 MLK Day, No Class Week 3: Intro to Cinema 4D Jan 27 Discussion Looking Outwards [0] - What did you find? Workout [0] - Any software issues? What did you make? Course Repo: CM2-IMD - You will be able to find the examples we talk about in class here. This week we are starting to look at C4D's comprehensive set of tools for creating assets that can be used in VR and AR. Many people use the tools for motion graphics, which you will quickly find as you start investigating the tutorials and resources out there. Just like other 3D design software, it can be a bit intimidating at first since there are so many ways to use it and so many tools to get familiar with. In my experience, it's best to start by focusing on understanding a few tools that help you accomplish a specific task, then continue exploring whats possible as you learn your way around. C4D is similar to Blender, Autodesk Maya, and After Effects in many ways and combines the best of some of these tools into something approachable for designers new to working in 3D. Most people working in the motion graphics world utilize some combination of C4D, After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop.

Before we jump further into building VR and AR applications, it's good to have some understanding of at least one 3D design workflow or toolset for producing content. Your objective this week is to investigate what designers are doing and how they are doing it to bring ideas to life. Whether producing content for ads or marketing, designing animated info graphics or data visualization, or exploring digital art or building games, understanding the role of motion design in our digital landscape is an essential part of any modern designers toolkit. 1. Identify 2-3 applications or aspects of motion design or motion graphics you find intriguing. * What's interesting to you about your findings? Try to be specific. 2. Identify 2-3 creatives (artists, designers, freelancers, agencies, collectives, etc) that are exploring motion design. * What are they making and how? * Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow. Share a link to your post with user group **@imd** in Slack channel **#cmstudio**. **_Due: Feb 3_** ???+ example \"Workout [1]: Getting Familiar with Cinema 4D\" This week I would like you to explore Cinema 4D as a tool for creating 3D assets for use in VR and AR applications. I assume most are new to the environment so just explore the resources below to get a feel for how to work with the tools. Most importantly, attempt to make something that you are interested in.

Blender Cinema4D Exporting FBX files for use in Adobe Aero or Unity How to bake dynamic animation to keyframed animation. For Adobe Aero there are several limitations in the current (1.0) version, but this will improve over time. It's a good time to start getting familiar with the types of animation that are possible. Read Key 3D modeling concepts: Animation from the Adobe Aero documentation to learn more. Mixamo Adobe Mixamo is a tool that lets your choose a character and animate it with a set of parameters. You can eaily upload human character models from Fuse or another character modeling workflow and auto-rig it. Once a model is rigged and has an animation you can export it for use in Adobe Aero, Unity, or for further manipulation in a 3D modeling environment. Common questions Upload and rig 3D characters with Mixamo Adobe Fuse Adobe Fuse is part of creative cloud and is currently available but will be removed from Creative Cloud in September 2020. Unfortunately Adobe Fuse does not run on macOS Catalina since it's a 32-bit application. Adobe is not supporting it anymore. We are forced to look at other character modeling tools like Make Human or DAZ3D for near-out-of-the-box character (humanoid/avatar) parametric modeling. ???+ note \"Looking Outwards [2]: Report on XR Assets\" Your objective this week is to investigate how assets are created for AR and VR. 1. Identify 2-3 tools that help designers create 2D or 3D assets for use in VR and AR and find some key learning resources for them. * What's interesting to you about your findings? Try to be specific. 2.

Week 5: Apple Development / Intro to Xcode Feb 10 Discussion Looking Outwards [2]: Report on XR Assets - What did you find? Workout [2]: Asset Workflows - What did you make? Minor change. \"Assignments\" are now referred to as \"Projects\". Questions on Cinema 4D, Unity, Adobe Aero, other stuff? This week we will work on getting everyone setup as Apple developers as part of our CMCI STUDIO team. We will then take a look at Xcode and start looking at how to start building apps using Unity and AR Foundation as time allows. We will be looking at different aspects of AR Foundation and scripting in the weeks ahead. iOS University Developer Program Getting started with app development Setup access to CMCI STUDIO team. I need the following. Send to me via Slack DM. I need your university (@colorado.edu) email address to add you to the team. I need some device information for any Apple device you will want to use. How to locate your device ID Next Steps: Get familiar with Xcode and all the development resources on developer.apple.com . Intro to Xcode Overview Team, Signing Certificate, Provisioning Profile (IMD) Building an iOS Application Run app in simulator and on a device Xcode Help References Getting started with iOS development - A section from the Unity manual. Good to be familiar with for building apps in Unity with the goal of putting them on iOS devices. Project #1: Asset Creation & Visualization Design a set of avatars / characters and environmental assets for use in VR or AR experiences. Create at least 1 avatar / character Create at least 2 environmental assets Tips: Using Cinema 4D, Make Human, Mixamo, Fuse, and/or another character building or 3D modeling workflows, design a collection of assets that can be used in VR and/or AR applications. What kind of assets? Each tool we've encountered so far has a set of tools and functions. For instance, Make Human is a parametric character modeling tool. The resulting human figures can be exported and imported into Mixamo for auto-rigging. Cinema 4D as you have seen is primarily used for motion graphics but can be used to animate dynamic 3D objects for use in other workflows such as Unity or Adobe Aero. Visualize your assets in an interesting way using Adobe Aero , Torch AR , and/or Unity. If using Adobe Aero or Torch AR, experiment with the built in behaviors (interaction and triggers) functionality to give your AR experience dynamic interactions. If using Unity, you likely are interested in building a VR expeirence using Steam VR. Follow the Unity + SteamVR tutorial to setup a basic VR world and configure object interaction and teleportation. Deliverable: Documentation in the form of a blog post of your design process and assets created. What were your goals and outcomes? Use screenshots, screen captures, renderings, gifs, Sketchfab viewers (for sharing 3D content), Github repos, and video. Include links to any tutorials, videos, and learning resources used. Be prepared to give a short presentation of your project next class. Share a link to your post with user group @imd in Slack channel #cmstudio . Due: Feb 17 Week 6: Intro to C# Scripting in Unity Feb 17 Discussion Project 1 Share Intro to AR Foundation next week Getting Started Download and Install Visual Studio if you haven\u2019t done it yet. Refer to the required software in the IMD Setup Guide . Scripting, Why and How? Scripts act as the glue between everything in Unity. They enable custom functionality between objects and systems, handle user input (interactions, touches, etc), allow GameObjects to interact with eachother, enable connectivity with networks, and much more. Scripts are simply added to GameObjects or used in combination with other C# files to build functionality through code. Visual Studio is the primary IDE tool for developing (writing code) scripts. What is scripting in Unity? A unity \"script\" is a C# file that contains a Class that inherits from MonoBehaviour . Read about Creating and Using Scripts . What is C#? A programming language. There are many resources online there to learn and practice. You can start with some of the resources below in the workout for this week. What is in a script? Lets find out! Primary References These are the primary references for learning about scripting in Unity. Bookmark and refer to as needed. Unity Scripting API Unity Manual: Scripting Scripting Overview Hello World Script Build a Unity Project Make a Cube GameObject. (What's a GameObject anyway? Lets look at the GameObject class in the Unity Scripting API .) Make a new script and add it as a Component to your new GameObject. Double click the script in the Assets folder to launch Visual Studio. Write code in Visual Studio to print to the Unity console from your script. Type the following code into your Start() function. Save the script. Debug.Log(\"Hello World!!\"); Press Play in Unity Cool! This should display your log message in the Unity console. Where to go for help Unity Forum Stack Overflow for Unity3D Google it of course! ???+ note \"Looking Outwards [3]: Identifying Functionality in Scripts\" 1. Identify a technique, behavior, or interaction that is made possible through the use of a script in Unity and write about it. It may help to do this after working through the tutorials in the workout. 2. Using the [Scripting Reference](ttps://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/index.html), locate and point out any relevant classes, properties, and/or methods that enable the functionality you have identified. For example, every object in Unity is a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) with a [transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject-transform.html) property and a [SetActive](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SetActive.html) method. The transform property is used to access the position, rotation, and scale of the object and the SetActive method is used to enable or disable the object. _TIP: [Watch this short video showing how to search the Unity Scripting Reference](https://youtu.be/PDeha4vRXXU). If you press **CMD + '** while highlighting a particular class or method in a script, you will launch the Unity Scripting API search in the browser. It will return the results of the search, which you can then locate the information you need. For example, in a script select the \"transform\" method text and press **CMD + '** to launch the search._ Share a link to your post with user group **@imd** in Slack channel **#cmstudio**. **_Due: Feb 24_** ???+ example \"Workout [3]: Scripting in Unity\" This week your task is start getting familiar with scripting in Unity by working through the following tutorials. 1. Start by working through the [Roll-a-Ball Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball-tutorial). It's a great starting point to understanding how to use a script for controlling object movement and interaction in a scene.

Workout [3]: Scripting in Unity - What did you make? Question for class - Continue with AR Foundation next week or move on to SteamVR? Questions - Unity, Scripting, Visual Studio, Docs, C# Language, etc AR Foundation What is AR Foundation? AR Foundation is a set of Unity packages that enable Unity based applications to build and run on AR compatible devices supporting ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android). Emerging Tech - It's still the early days of learning to use this tool and lots of things are still in flux. The package has only been around for a few years and supported by a handful of devices but this will soon shift as more AR compatible devices come to market. In short, the time to start learning how to work with these tools is NOW. The best resource to staying up to date is the Unity Blog, AR/VR (XR) Unity Forum , and the AR Foundation Docs . AR Foundation Overview Building Unity Applications for iOS We will walk through this process together to make sure everyone is able to build Xcode projects from Unity, open in Xcode, and compile to run on a mobile device. in this workflow we will be building a Unity iOS application without AR Foundation to get the hang of the build process.

Mar 2 Discussion Looking Outwards [4]: Understanding AR Foundation - What did you find? Workout [4]: Building AR Foundation Applications for iOS - What did you make? Questions - Unity, Scripting, Visual Studio, Docs, C# Language, etc Working with Mobile Inputs Learning how to use mobile inputs is important for building mobile AR experiences. How does a user interact with your application on a mobile device and how is it different than another device like a keyboard or VR controller? Lets look at a few examples of user interaction that are unique to mobile devices. Touch Interactions Touch Pressure Example Joystick Example Device Movement Accelerometer Example Roll-a-Ball for Mobile Example AR Foundation Lets explore the sample files a bit. Lets look at what they do and how they work at a high level. Dilmer Valecillos Youtube Tutorials - He has the most videos on AR Foundation development.

For the time being you do not need to make it capable of AR with AR Foundation. We will continue to explore how to design for AR and VR in the weeks ahead. Create a Unity scene and place objects or assets into it. At least 1 animated avatar or character or 3D object in the scene. At least 2 environmental assets to make it visually interesting. Experiment with it. Tip: Look back at previous resources for ways to make and animate characters or objects. Adapt any lessons or techniques learned by watching the Unity Create with Code tutorials or other tutorials that explore ways to visually enhance Unity scenes. Use an interaction method such as touch or device orientation to cause a change in the scene. If using touch interaction, you could cause a change in the character or object's transform (position, scale, rotation), appearance (color), visibility (active or not active). Similarily, if using the accelerometer, you could cause a change to a game object based on the orientation of the device. Tip: This part will require you to write at least one C# script to handle the interaction(s). Look at the examples on interaction above for ways to do this. To prototype with a mobile device tethered you can download the Unity Remote 5 app from the App Store. Learn more about using Unity Remote .

Roll-a-Ball for Mobile Example - A mobile implementation of the Roll-a-Ball tutorial that uses the accelerometer to control motion of the ball. Build your Unity project for iOS and run on a mobile device. Create a build for your scene. Compile using Xcode and run on your device. Tip: Refer to the notes and workout from last week for how to do this. Capture video recording on your device and include in documentation. Tip: Refer to the guide on Mobile Screen Capture or look at How to record the screen on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch . Deliverable: Documentation in the form of a blog post of your creative process and experience. What were your goals and outcomes? Use screenshots, screen captures, renderings, gifs, Sketchfab viewers (for sharing 3D content), Github repos, and video. Include links to any tutorials, videos, and learning resources used.

This week we are starting to look at C4D's comprehensive set of tools for creating assets that can be used in VR and AR. Many people use the tools for motion graphics, which you will quickly find as you start investigating the tutorials and resources out there. Just like other 3D design software, it can be a bit intimidating at first since there are so many ways to use it and so many tools to get familiar with. In my experience, it's best to start by focusing on understanding a few tools that help you accomplish a specific task, then continue exploring whats possible as you learn your way around. C4D is similar to Blender, Autodesk Maya, and After Effects in many ways and combines the best of some of these tools into something approachable for designers new to working in 3D. Most people working in the motion graphics world utilize some combination of C4D, After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop.

Refer to the required software in the IMD Setup Guide . Scripting, Why and How? Scripts act as the glue between everything in Unity. They enable custom functionality between objects and systems, handle user input (interactions, touches, etc), allow GameObjects to interact with eachother, enable connectivity with networks, and much more. Scripts are simply added to GameObjects or used in combination with other C# files to build functionality through code. Visual Studio is the primary IDE tool for developing (writing code) scripts. What is scripting in Unity? A unity \"script\" is a C# file that contains a Class that inherits from MonoBehaviour . Read about Creating and Using Scripts . What is C#? A programming language. There are many resources online there to learn and practice. You can start with some of the resources below in the workout for this week. What is in a script? Lets find out! Primary References These are the primary references for learning about scripting in Unity. Bookmark and refer to as needed. Unity Scripting API Unity Manual: Scripting Scripting Overview Hello World Script Build a Unity Project Make a Cube GameObject. (What's a GameObject anyway? Lets look at the GameObject class in the Unity Scripting API .) Make a new script and add it as a Component to your new GameObject. Double click the script in the Assets folder to launch Visual Studio. Write code in Visual Studio to print to the Unity console from your script. Type the following code into your Start() function. Save the script. Debug.Log(\"Hello World!!\"); Press Play in Unity Cool! This should display your log message in the Unity console. Where to go for help Unity Forum Stack Overflow for Unity3D Google it of course! ???+ note \"Looking Outwards [3]: Identifying Functionality in Scripts\" 1. Identify a technique, behavior, or interaction that is made possible through the use of a script in Unity and write about it. It may help to do this after working through the tutorials in the workout. 2. Using the [Scripting Reference](ttps://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/index.html), locate and point out any relevant classes, properties, and/or methods that enable the functionality you have identified. For example, every object in Unity is a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html) with a [transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject-transform.html) property and a [SetActive](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SetActive.html) method. The transform property is used to access the position, rotation, and scale of the object and the SetActive method is used to enable or disable the object. _TIP: [Watch this short video showing how to search the Unity Scripting Reference](https://youtu.be/PDeha4vRXXU). If you press **CMD + '** while highlighting a particular class or method in a script, you will launch the Unity Scripting API search in the browser. It will return the results of the search, which you can then locate the information you need. For example, in a script select the \"transform\" method text and press **CMD + '** to launch the search._ Share a link to your post with user group **@imd** in Slack channel **#cmstudio**. **_Due: Feb 24_** ???+ example \"Workout [3]: Scripting in Unity\" This week your task is start getting familiar with scripting in Unity by working through the following tutorials. 1. Start by working through the [Roll-a-Ball Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball-tutorial). It's a great starting point to understanding how to use a script for controlling object movement and interaction in a scene. If you have already gone through this tutorial, then proceed to work through the tutorials below or expand upon what you learned in the Roll-a-Ball Tutorial. 2. Work through [Unit 1 - Player Control](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation?courseId=5cf96c41edbc2a2ca6e8810f) in the course [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code).

AR Foundation is a set of Unity packages that enable Unity based applications to build and run on AR compatible devices supporting ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android). Emerging Tech - It's still the early days of learning to use this tool and lots of things are still in flux. The package has only been around for a few years and supported by a handful of devices but this will soon shift as more AR compatible devices come to market. In short, the time to start learning how to work with these tools is NOW. The best resource to staying up to date is the Unity Blog, AR/VR (XR) Unity Forum , and the AR Foundation Docs . AR Foundation Overview Building Unity Applications for iOS We will walk through this process together to make sure everyone is able to build Xcode projects from Unity, open in Xcode, and compile to run on a mobile device. in this workflow we will be building a Unity iOS application without AR Foundation to get the hang of the build process.

Create a Unity scene and place objects or assets into it. At least 1 animated avatar or character or 3D object in the scene. At least 2 environmental assets to make it visually interesting. Experiment with it. Tip: Look back at previous resources for ways to make and animate characters or objects. Adapt any lessons or techniques learned by watching the Unity Create with Code tutorials or other tutorials that explore ways to visually enhance Unity scenes. Use an interaction method such as touch or device orientation to cause a change in the scene. If using touch interaction, you could cause a change in the character or object's transform (position, scale, rotation), appearance (color), visibility (active or not active). Similarily, if using the accelerometer, you could cause a change to a game object based on the orientation of the device. Tip: This part will require you to write at least one C# script to handle the interaction(s). Look at the examples on interaction above for ways to do this.

It is a studio-based course that explores the product development process through algorithmic modeling strategies, computational design, and additive manufacturing. In this course students will learn from the ground up how to utilize McNeel Rhinoceros with Grasshopper--a visual programming environment for algorithmic modeling, to design parametric systems and how to translate digital objects into physical form through 3D printing. Students will be introduced to the emerging field of parametric product design by developing projects that explore a multitude of form-finding strategies in surface patterning and complex geometric modeling of everyday objects spanning a variety of scales and applications. Familiar examples of product categories ripe for design experimentation include common objects such as pens and speakers, household items such as furniture and lighting, and personal items such as clothing, razors, and jewelry. In addition, students will develop an understanding of how to evaluate and optimize their designs based on product constraints, use cases, materiality, form, and function of physical objects produced through iterative cycles of production.

It is expected that all students are active participants in each session. This course will require considerable effort outside of class time. Plan work sessions with others as much as possible and be sure to take care of your mind and body so as not to get too stressed or overexert yourself. If you should need assistance managing stress or otherwise, you can get in touch with CAPS . Deliverables This is an experimental project based course, largely driven by student research and interests. Each week will follow a similar format when it comes to finding balance between theory and practice. It's expected that each student has varying skills and interests upon entering the course and are excited to expand on them and apply them towards their areas of interest. The course deliverables consist of \" Looking Outwards \" Reports to discover the emerging boundaries of parametric product design and report on them, Workouts to develop skills in 2D/3D design with Rhino and Grasshopper, digital fabrication, and product design, Projects to put research findings into practice and exercise creative faculties, and a Final Project to develop a product design system and family of physical products. Each deliverable is expected to vary based on the area of interest and parameters defined. The following outlines the general criteria for course deliverables throughout the semester. Looking Outwards What is a \"Looking Outwards\" Report? It's basically a blog post containing your research, thoughts, and ideas on a particular topic of interest. This means you should be looking at a variety of information sources such as blogs, emerging tech news, research papers, design/art/tech focused websites, tutorials, etc. covering the topics listed under Course Themes and reporting on what you find each week. These kinds of reports are due almost every week as noted in the schedule and count towards 10% of your final grade. This approach is inspired by Prof. Golan Levin's Looking Outwards Reports for the course Interactivity & Computation at CMU School of Art. Why are we doing these? There are a few reasons: Reason 1: I literally can\u2019t keep up with the changes taking place in the various fields related to parametric design and I need your help. Many hands make light work. You are the pioneers of this class and are tasked with discovering content and creating documentation that adds to the field of Parametric Product Design. Reason 2: We need to build a body of documentation that connect several disparate fields. Conducting research across several fields will uncover new and interesting opportunities for us. Throughout the semester I will document our collective findings under Looking Outwards (found in the left sidebar under CM 3 PPD). Workouts What is a \"Workout\"? A workout is some kind of weekly exercise that aims to practice and build skills. What form do these take? They can take the form of reading technical documentation, writing code, solving a design challenge, trying out new software, and working through video tutorials that challenge and enable practice of concepts discussed in class. These are not graded but are highly recommended because they will provide greater understanding of a specific topic through focused hands-on practice. You may write blog posts for the workouts you do to help document your progress and process but it's not required. Projects What is a Project? A project aims to solve a problem or accomplish a goal using tools and skills. What form do these take? They are largely based on the topics explored in class, through the workouts, and through your research. They allow you to dig into and expand on a topic that interests you within the field of Parametric Product Design. They can be thought of as mini-projects to build towards developing your final project or one-off experiments exploring a particular technique or software workflow you are interested in. Projects are due every few weeks as noted on the schedule and count towards 40% of your final grade. Final Project Read more about writing a project proposal and final project deliverables here . Grading & Evaluation Grades for the course follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown. Type Percentage of Grade Looking Outwards 10 % Workouts Not graded Projects 40 % Final Project 50 % Work is evaluated based on the following: Done vs Not Done. Done gets credit, Not Done does not get credit. Quality and Quantity of deliverables. This studio based course requires a healthy level of creative immersion and balance to be successful. Explore your creative process through making and always deliver to the best of your abilities. Achieve quality through quantity. Engagement with the subject matter. If something isn't interesting to you, make it interesting. Clarity of documentation. Make it easy for others to read and understand. Collaboration will also be a factor of evaluation if you choose to work on projects in teams of no more than 3-4 people. The division of duties on any project needs to be clearly defined and documented by all team members and will factor into individual evaluations. Week 1: Overview Jan 17 (Friday) Overview of Course Course Deliverables PPD Setup Guide Parametric Design (Fall 2019) ???+ note \"Looking Outwards [0]: The Parametric Design Landscape\" Begin to investigate the field of parametric design and what designers working parametrically are doing. Much of the work out there falls into the domain of architecture because they are the primary users of parametric design software. But, what if we begin to focus in on products that modern digital fabrication techniques such as laser cutting, 3d printing, and cnc milling can produce? What new forms are possible with both access to powerful design software in combination with the ability to physically make? 1. Identify 2-3 areas ripe for parametric design experimentation. * What kinds of products can you imagine benefiting from parametric design? 2. Identify 2-3 creatives (designers, architects, etc) that are making interesting forms, objects, installations, or artifacts. * What are they making? * Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow. What's inspiring about the work? * What kinds of tools are they using?

This week you need to download and install the required software listed in the [PPD Setup Guide](/guides/ppd-setup-guide/). You can use Rhino for 90 days with no restrictions. I suggest purchasing a license after the trial period from the CU Bookstore for $90. 2. Start reading through some of the listed resources for learning Rhino and Grasshopper. There are many great tutorials and channels on YouTube that cover different aspects of the environment and ways of working. I think you will quickly find that the quality and content varies quite a bit so it's good to have some foundational skills under your belt before jumping into lots of video tutorials. If you are brand new to Rhino you will want to go through some basic Rhino tutorials to get familiar with the environment.

Identify some examples of products that make use of 2D and/or 3D patterns. Analyze the patterns used in attempt to deconstruct them and identify key characteristics. Sometimes you can start a design exploration from a pattern of interest. Is the pattern 2D, 3D, or a combination? Is it made of [tesselations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation) or [tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons)? Is there a kind of [symmetry](http://math.cmu.edu/~bkell/21110-2010s/symmetry-tilings.html)? Are the patterns more organic and natural in appearance? How are the patterns produced - by hand, machine, process or combination?

Workout [1]: Exploring Patterns - What did you make? Discussion / studio session ???+ note \"Looking Outwards [2]: Patterns with Purpose\" Expand this week on how patterns are used in products you admire. Look closer at the pattern systems used in these products and try to extract the layers of logic they contain. Why is the patterning used? Is it form, function, both? What is it's purpose? Build off your research from last week or identify a few new items to deconstruct for this week. The references below are for inspiration and encouragement of the work that goes into designing really anything. They are good reminders that design, parametric or not, it takes lots of experimentation, focus, and trial and error to develop your style and skills. This is why making lots of things on the regular is so important. Your idea typically doesn't come together on the first try.

Reason 2: We need to build a body of documentation that connect several disparate fields. Conducting research across several fields will uncover new and interesting opportunities for us. Throughout the semester I will document our collective findings under Looking Outwards (found in the left sidebar under CM 3 PPD).","title":"Looking Outwards"},{"location":"APRD-5017/#workouts","text":"What is a \"Workout\"? A workout is some kind of weekly exercise that aims to practice and build skills. What form do these take? They can take the form of reading technical documentation, writing code, solving a design challenge, trying out new software, and working through video tutorials that challenge and enable practice of concepts discussed in class. These are not graded but are highly recommended because they will provide greater understanding of a specific topic through focused hands-on practice. You may write blog posts for the workouts you do to help document your progress and process but it's not required.","title":"Workouts"},{"location":"APRD-5017/#projects","text":"What is a Project? A project aims to solve a problem or accomplish a goal using tools and skills. What form do these take? They are largely based on the topics explored in class, through the workouts, and through your research. They allow you to dig into and expand on a topic that interests you within the field of Parametric Product Design. They can be thought of as mini-projects to build towards developing your final project or one-off experiments exploring a particular technique or software workflow you are interested in.

Done gets credit, Not Done does not get credit. Quality and Quantity of deliverables. This studio based course requires a healthy level of creative immersion and balance to be successful. Explore your creative process through making and always deliver to the best of your abilities. Achieve quality through quantity. Engagement with the subject matter. If something isn't interesting to you, make it interesting. Clarity of documentation. Make it easy for others to read and understand. Collaboration will also be a factor of evaluation if you choose to work on projects in teams of no more than 3-4 people.

Much of the work out there falls into the domain of architecture because they are the primary users of parametric design software. But, what if we begin to focus in on products that modern digital fabrication techniques such as laser cutting, 3d printing, and cnc milling can produce? What new forms are possible with both access to powerful design software in combination with the ability to physically make? 1. Identify 2-3 areas ripe for parametric design experimentation. * What kinds of products can you imagine benefiting from parametric design? 2. Identify 2-3 creatives (designers, architects, etc) that are making interesting forms, objects, installations, or artifacts. * What are they making? * Try to identify specifically what is interesting to you about their work and workflow.

This week you need to download and install the required software listed in the [PPD Setup Guide](/guides/ppd-setup-guide/). You can use Rhino for 90 days with no restrictions. I suggest purchasing a license after the trial period from the CU Bookstore for $90. 2. Start reading through some of the listed resources for learning Rhino and Grasshopper. There are many great tutorials and channels on YouTube that cover different aspects of the environment and ways of working. I think you will quickly find that the quality and content varies quite a bit so it's good to have some foundational skills under your belt before jumping into lots of video tutorials.

Identify some examples of products that make use of 2D and/or 3D patterns. Analyze the patterns used in attempt to deconstruct them and identify key characteristics. Sometimes you can start a design exploration from a pattern of interest. Is the pattern 2D, 3D, or a combination? Is it made of [tesselations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation) or [tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons)? Is there a kind of [symmetry](http://math.cmu.edu/~bkell/21110-2010s/symmetry-tilings.html)? Are the patterns more organic and natural in appearance? How are the patterns produced - by hand, machine, process or combination?

Node.js apps require a system that allows a Javascript runtime (process) to run all the time using a process management tool like PM2 . This means a \"shared host\" like Bluehost or another service that offers budget shared hosting typically doesn't support running apps like this. Below are some tutorials from hosts that offer these kinds of servers. Another important thing to mention is when you work with hosts like Digital Ocean or Heroku, you typically have to setup and configure the \"server instance\", which means you become the administrator responsible for installing and configuring the operating system (Ubuntu or another form of Linux or Windows) to be a web server.

To use: Navigate to your project directory: cd /Users/username/code Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git my-project-name This will clone the cm-sandbox repo into a new project folder named my-project-name . Now you have a starting point for a new web project running with live-server . If you plan to make any commits to a repo on Github with this new project folder you will need to create a repo on Github with the same project name and assign the remote to your repo. Assign a new remote to your new project repo. Assuming I have a new project folder called my-project-name and a new repo on Github with the same name, follow the steps below and replace the remote URL with your new repo URL. cd my-project-name git remote -v You will see something like this returned: origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/rjduran/cm-sandbox.git (push) Copy the url to your new Github repo and use with the git remote command then push the changes to your repo. Check what the remote is set to by using the git remote command as above. It should be updated with your new project URL. Prior to pushing the changes you can make any edits to the files in the repo and add them and commit them. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/rjduran/my-project-name.git git remote -v git push -u origin master You can read more about changing remotes between HTTPS and SSH and vice versa here . How to Build a Sandbox Create a local development workspace (aka sandbox ) to prototype with HTML, CSS, and JS. By the end of this you should have something that looks like my cm-sandbox repo. What is the purpose of this? To become familiar with the file types, languages, and how they work together. At a fundamental level this approach to experimentation establishes good development practices and efficient workflows. It also supports hands-on learning, which is the only way to improve as a programmer. As a programmer you want to be in control of your code, tools, workflow, and system. ( Don't let the computer control you. ). Pro Tip: Setup a working directory for all programming projects (For Example, /Users/username/code ). This directory then becomes your goto location for anything having to do with code, programming, cloning repos from github, experimenting with new tools and software, and more. This is precisely how I organize my system. Download and install Node.js and live-server . Verify node and npm are installed via Terminal: node -v && npm -v . You should see two version numbers matching what you installed. Install live-server globally: npm install -g live-server If you have done all this correctly you should be able to type npm list -g --depth 0 and see that the live-server module has been installed. You can also type live-server in your terminal and start a server at the default address http://127.0.0.1:8080 from your current folder. Create a Github account and make a repository for your web project (as demonstrated in class). You can name the repo anything you want. For example, \"cm-sandbox\". Clone a copy of this repository to your machine via Terminal. git clone <repo-url> . Setup your machine to make use of a local development folder and local development server (See tip above and Step 1). Create 3 files in your web project repository folder (ie. the project \"folder\" or \"repo\" you created and then cloned from Github in step 3). index.html - ( quick boilerplate template , copy and paste code from here) style.css script.js Launch your local development server ( live-server ) via Terminal and code editor of choice (ex.

It will be http://localhost:8080 or something similar. Create a basic html page using validated markup (Hint: Using a tool like FreeFormatter , check that your code works as expected.)

When you setup a new computer this is automatically assigned a hostname matching your username and computer type. This name identifies your computer on a local area network. For example, rjdurans-macbook-pro or something similar. To change your hostname for your computer goto System Preference > Sharing and enter a different name for the Computer Name . On a local network your computer is identified as hostname.local. In my case it is rjd.local. You can also type hostname into your terminal and see the current hostname. What's the tilde character \"~\" mean? The tilde (~) character is used to indicate your home directory in the terminal. It's a shorthand for /Users/username . For example, to goto your Desktop folder from anywhere on your system you can type in cd ~/Desktop . How can I shorten the command line prompt? To understand how this works you need to know that there are hidden configuration files loaded when you start a terminal session. They are located in your home directory and are named .profile, .bash_profile, and .bashrc. It's possible that these files don't exist yet but you can simply create them by using the touch command or with vscode. For instance, touch ~/.bash_profile will create a new hidden file called .bash_profile in your home directory. After doing this you can edit the file in vscode. Open the file and enter the following line then save to instantly shorten the command prompt next time you open a new terminal.

What is a GIF? At a basic level, a GIF is an animated image made up of a series of images or frames of a video. It's typically very small in size, which means the quality is far less than standard or high definition video and often appears a bit grainy if highly compressed. They are useful for sharing bite-size bundles of visual content. For instance, say you are trying to share a visual concept or UI design as a series of short animations. The most compact and way to do this is to generate GIFs vs using a high-res movie file. Many times, the same meaning can be conveyed in short simple bits of content.

Getting Started Before you can write blog posts you need a place to put the blog posts you write. Most students in the program choose to use Medium because other courses make use of it for assignments, but you can use any platform you wish. Take a look at some alternatives under Blogs, Wikis, and Content Management Systems (CMS) if you would like to use another tool. Once you have a blog, you are ready to write posts. You can follow the criteria below and customize for any deliverable. What's in a post? A title that clearly describes the subject matter. It is recommended that a post includes a variety of media and content to support the subject matter. For example: text, images, video, graphics, photos, mockups, screen captures, tutorials, 3d model viewers (sketchfab), sketches, code, gifs, references, etc. Anything that is required to effectively communicate the details of a project, process, prototype, or idea. The subject matter is in response to the topics of the week. Ideally, it falls in line with your interests, research area, project, creative process, etc. For example, you might consider doing a series of tutorials on a topic that interests you or a process/workflow you are currently exploring through the course. Posts should be written to the best of your abilities and for a public audience.

Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran\u2019s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at: http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html and at http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs Disability If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions: Injuries, Surgeries, and Illnesses guidelines under Quick Links at Disability Services website and discuss your needs with your professor. Religious Observance Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. Please notify me as quickly as possible regarding any possible absences so that we can plan your work accordingly. See full details at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html Discrimination and Harassment The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. The University of Colorado does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational programs and activities. (Regent Law, Article 10, amended 11/8/2001). CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, \"Protected Classes\" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or veteran status. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be obtained at http://hr.colorado.edu/dh/ Honor Code All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and at http://honorcode.colorado.edu Athletic Events The Boulder Campus has two separate but similar policies governing conflicts between a student's athletic events and his or her classes and exams. One policy governs students involved in intercollegiate varsity athletic events. The other policy governs students involved in Club Sports events. Each policy is accompanied by a detailed report with guidance on how instructors may deal with conflicts when they arise. Both policies may be viewed in detail on the Boulder Faculty Assembly's website: Policy on conflicts involving Intercollegiate Athletics, http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/committees/IAC.html Policy on conflicts involving Club Sports http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/committees/studentaffairs.html The two policies are substantially similar, having the following terms in common: That it is the student's responsibility to notify each instructor, in the first week of the semester and in writing, about any known conflicts between academic requirements and athletic events. That instructors have full authority to decide whether and/or how to accommodate those conflicts. While an instructor has the right to refuse to make accommodations, he or she is permitted to provide such accommodations. That coaches are forbidden from initiating contact with instructors regarding schedule conflicts, grades, or academic progress. The Intercollegiate Athletics Office of Academic Support Services and the Recreation Center's Collegiate Club Sports coordinators may contact instructors about certain topics. There is no rule preventing faculty from contacting these support organizations.Policy terms that are specific to intercollegiate varsity events, as opposed to club sports events, include: That intercollegiate varsity athletic events during final exams, which are normally forbidden by university policy, must be approved in writing by the BFA Intercollegiate Athletics Committee well in advance of the event. Students involved in these events must then work with their instructors in regard to any missed work.","title":"CU Policies and Procedures"},{"location":"studio-handbook/policies/#cu-policies-and-procedures","text":"","title":"CU Policies and Procedures"},{"location":"studio-handbook/policies/#classroom-behavior","text":"Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment.

SteamVR Plugin 2.2.0 (Last Update: Jan 30, 2019) Github Docs Unity Asset Store OpenVR - SteamVR is using OpenVR behind the scenes to communicate with the SteamVR Runtime. The Wiki for OpenVR talks about more of the underlying API. You don't need to download anything else. Build a Unity project and add the SteamVR plugin Make a new Unity project. Name it \"MySteamVRProject.\" Import plugin SteamVR from asset store Search for SteamVR and click Import. Click Import when prompted. A dialog comes up that shows what files will be included.It may take a moment to include everything in the package. Click Accept All when prompted with the recommended project settings. You will see a confirmation that says \u201cYou have made the right choice\u201d. Click Ok. Now you should see the SteamVR folder under Assets. Disable or remove the default Main Camera in the Inspector Keep the included Directional Light or add a Point Light and disable any unused lights. Add a Plane and Cube to the scene Move the Cube up in the Z direction by 1 unit. Add the Player prefab found under SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Core/Prefabs. This includes the camera and controller objects. Generate the action.js file by navigating to Unity menu Window > SteamVR Input. Click Yes when prompted to save a copy of the example json files. Click Save and Generate on the SteamVR Input dialog. Once that\u2019s done there will be an example scene file in Assets/SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Samples/Interactions_Example.unity. Explore this scene or go back to the default SampleScene file you started with. Start adding other objects into the scene. Hit play and put on the VIVE References Player How to Add Teleportation Create an empty GameObject Locate and add the Teleporting prefab found under SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Teleport/Prefabs. 3. This is the primary object for managing teleportation functionality. Add one or more TeleportPoint game objects found under SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Teleport/Prefabs.
